## The Development of Great Arts: a Short History

The Great Arts is a tradition of spiritual formation under Solar religion. It is a strand of core intellectual tradition originating from the Intercalary period, often associated with Gaudschalk of Orbein and his works. The core tenet of the Great Arts stems from the balance of Phos and Umbra in the abode. The study of Phos and Umbra formed the core of the Arts of the Day (*Ars Diei*) and the Arts of the Night (*Ars Noctis*). Since the rise of *Facies Nova* (or Blast Furnace) as the new face of Sol in the World-of-the-Days, many have changed - including the Arts. But its core remains unchanged. It is an observation of the Abode, an epistemology of Phos, a cartography of the World-of-the-dreams, not mythic power affecting World-of-the-days. 

The Great Arts is not sectarian, but the contents it study can always be sectarian, nor can a practitioner's thought being completely non-sectarian, therefore the Great Arts is always dangerous, albeit differently from the crude Invisible Arts (one might call this magic). Menisca, as the eternal protector of knowledge and secrets in shadow, protects the integrity of all *collegia* and her edicts are to be followed b the Questionary. The cost of this protection is that the secret may never be revealed to those who have not stepped into the World-of-the-dreams, or the individual will be subject to not Menisca but to a Quaestor's jurisdiction.

In its core, the Great Arts explores two aspects of the world: Phos and Umbra. *Ars Diei* is the obsession with the miracles of Phos, exploring the outer form of the abode, the transmutation of matter and the translation of Phos into different worlds. One might call it Natural Knowledge; while *Ars Noctis* is the exploration of the unseen in the Umbra, including the transformation of Umbra, the road in the World-of-the-dreams, and the art of hush and silence. One might call it Spiritual Knowledge. The two together might be called Knowledge or "Science," but in the present age it seems *Ars Diei* has more secular value. From the age of Antiochos Batrachos to the age of Chalybis, people always desire some Orichalcum ring better than spiritual fullness.

Initiates, keepers and scholars of the Great Arts strive to chart the paths of Sun within the World-of-the-dreams, and then transform them into tangible inspiration, memories or knowledge. Sometimes it was only a matter of studying and enhancing the soul. Sometimes it is about improving an aspect of the Great Arts. Sometimes it is about archaeology and preservation, such as studying the old rites of the ancient *Ecclesia Solis Invicti*. Great Arts at times might not have intrinstic, worldly value, but this does not mean they are impotent. Words can have power. Books like *The Travels of Chevalier Thomas de Mandeville*, opera like those works of the Sciorezese *camerata*, or the treatise on natural philosophy by Sir Isaac Wood - they have subtle influences on the flow of Phos and Umbra in places and influences to the robustness of soul. From a pure utilitarian level, the study of Great Arts anchors the world from being destroyed by contested, overtly "worldly" acts without a level of spirituality.

The archaeological aspect of Great Arts is of utmost importance. The systematic charting and reconstruction of pre-Intercalary, Intercalary, and pre-Chalybisian languages, allowed obscure languages such as Weliouglyph (Sun-glyphpics) and Cherukisk to be seen as precursors to later Thalassaran and Giselic languages. The systematic edition of manuscripts is also shown in the works of various collegia, in particular *Monumenta Historiai Phaetonae*, helped key texts to be preserved and referenced by scholars. With the collaboration of the Questionary, many of these texts are further published in their censored version to the public as materials for historical study.

The institution of study is called *Collegia Studiorum*, these are often branches attached to a formal university or a research institute with the permission of the Questionary. The administrative attachment does not mean they receive funding. On the contrary, the collegian scholars are often involved in franchising and merchandising the research to obtain necessary worldly wealth. In the early post-Intercalary age, scholars craft Ichor Solis for liturgical use (as nowadays), refine materials like Adamantium or Orichalcum and sell them at a fixed price regulated by the Questionary. In our time, some of them just runs a secondary job such as producing music, painting, or even preforming work as a technical specialist in various forms. Sometimes they are also holding a position in  institutions to earn salary to fund their own researches. Iin a world not without miracles of Phos and small, fantastical moments or needs to explore mental complexity, there are always a job to do.

The earliest collegium was *Collegia Phari*, which is decreed formally by duke Alessandro II of Parthenope to the Longonian scholar and Illuminatist Charles of Nice, who is later also called "Charles le Clerc" in Synonese and "Carlo di Nizza" in Lecipian. Initially it is but a small seminar of nine initiates who regularly discusses various topics together, but later they sought jurisdictional protection from the duke and obtained an immunity charter. In exchange, their foundry will provide the king some gifts, for instance, lenses and lamps to use in the palace. One of Carlo's disciples was Henry of Munegu, who is overtly partisan in politics and get killed in an aristocratic feud. Many later call him "Henri Malclerc," the bad cleric. Henry the Bad was extremely famous for forging a string of charters which not only ensured immunity and internal election of the collegia community, but also asserted his own ownership of various parcels of lands around Munegu, Nizza, Albenga, and Illumo Vittore. His personal ambition stoppe abruptly when he himself got into a feud with the count of Ligûtisa and got killed by a raiding party.

The practitioners of the Great Arts are not only theologians, but also naturalists, for a stone can also be a wonder of Sol, Ys the city unfounded is and will be found someday, a spring can be the immediate reflection of Sol's design, a new species is by its own a miracle of development from the creation according to the divine rule of evolution, and much more. It is too easy to imagine these being armchair scholars, but one should also see them as explorers, navigators, even merchants and diplomats. The first ever Phaetonan to reach Sunpu (駿府), Bernat of Balaguer, was a theologian and one of the earliest students of Gaudschalk of Orbein, who compassed his own ship and sailed across the Ocassus Ocean and reached Mizuho Island. Sakai Sōkyū and Lin Jianxiu, who are the first of the Ciencionese to reach the southern cape of Apriconia, were the students of Bernat.

Despite claims to be meritocratic, Great Arts often found itself at odds with the very idea of being open and absorbing those worthy of being initiates. Nepotism, corruption, intervention, *gakubatsu*, all are inevitable phenomenon constantly threatening the idea of the Collegia. According to the Edict of the Three, the total number of initiates who enter the World-of-the-dreams is limited, but it is harder to find who has more potential to enter to make "chances not wasted." Few people can be less corrupted or maintain a high moral standard like Yi Sang, the young post-doctoral researcher on speculology and other Night Arts, who devoted his whole life into the development of the refractive window which really helps one to see their own possibility in Phos. His poverty, however, was more palpable. When his idea was stolen by his colleague Kim Jicheol, he wasn't able to afford a suit against Kim. As the dispute still goes on, how can one be more optimistic than pessimistic about the future of the Collegia?

In the World-of-the-days, no one usually cares about the Great Arts. The technical details they study are mundane and far from the beliefs of the public. Moreover, unsystematic observations are meaningless for understanding the Abode. In order to prevent the circulation of works, the practitioners usually use very difficult semi-artificial universal languages ​​and special inks to write and communicate. Among them, the more common one is Lingua Erreca, but Erikapaios, Tsunginese and Symorgian is also common. Physical distance is also a good way of diverting (or not diverting) public attention, such as going to the Evening Isles far away from the main trade routes to hide from attention. Of course, there are also people who stay on a pillar or in the desert every day. These people are sometimes hailed as contemporary sages, but in fact they may just be observing something in the sky or daydreaming. But they somehow become new stylites and a new Illuminator Antonius. This is rather amusing to many of us who do spend a lot of time on the armchair.
