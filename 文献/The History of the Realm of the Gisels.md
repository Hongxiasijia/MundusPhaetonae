The History of the Giselreich

#### The Preface of Lampert, Metropolitan Speaker of the Church in Trufer

A great many things keep happening, some of them good and some of them bad, both remain nevertheless memorable. My intention, with the help of the Holy and Indivisible Quaternitarian Wielders of Solar Authority, is to write a little book, to lay out the traditions about the Gisel people, from the very commencement of its existence to the day we live. I have written this work to keep alive the memory of those dead and gone, and to bring them to the notice of future generations, because as the Phosters have said, 'To constantly reform and improve oneself, one must always strives to learn more,' and a well-written history is a good mirror of human deeds. The subject is one that demands immense labour. Yet reader, my style is not very polished, and I have to devote portions of my text to the study of history itself.

There are, indeed, many traditions of what happened prior to many things: then ancestors of the Gisel people, the life and deeds of Wisaword the Apostle, the foundation of Giselwiek, the rule of Walthuharjaz the Hegemon, and so on. Many had, out of their love of knowledge, their pursuit of personal refinement and their intention to provide exemplars for the posterity, or sometimes aggrandising certain rulers and courts, written many books of history which, some preserved into our days, some preserved in excepts in pages or excepts, while some were completely lost. But the intention of my writing is to inspire you readers, on the subject of the life and morals of the community, and the men through their qualities contributed to the steadfastness of the common welfare. But equally I wish to represent to you the other side: the impiety, wickedness, the short-sightedness of many, who misused the power conceded to them by the state and breaks the concordance and peace of the realm.

There is this exceptionally beneficial and fruitful advantage to be derived from the study of the past, that you see, set in the clear light of historical truth, examples of every possible type. From these you may select for yourself what to imitate, and also what, as being mischievous in its inception and disastrous in its issues, you are to avoid. And should anyone say that I am simply rehashing familiar matter, much of what I say having been already set out, at length, many years ago, I would reply that man’s ingenuity and his innovations are every day extended, so that as time goes on, new subtleties are found which the ancients could not have imagined – so that my own book must have at least some use.

Hence this prologue as an introduction to this book, so ends my prologue.

## Buch Eins

#### A *Credo* of Lampert

Proposing as I do to describe the history of the Gisels, I wish first all to explain briefly my beliefs, so that whoever reads me may know that this history is not written for the believers of *Sol Indomitus*, but from one who believes that: Sol the Almighty, originally with the false name *Sol Invictus*, in facing the catastrophe called Intercalation granted Its authority (*Oberecheit*) to the Three, namely the First-Light (*Erstelieht*), the Watchman (*Wächtäre*) and the Sun-in-rags (*Lampensunne*), and the Moon, also called the Menisca; that the Quaternity are the extension of Its authority in the same Essence, which despite seemingly neutral as the laws of nature, indeed has an eternal, clement intention (*Thelema*); that the Four, being the protector of Its rules, which was established in the creation, will ensure the proper ending and return towards the House of Sol, which is in balance and need not to be disturbed by the Second Dawn; of the End of World I believe it is merely a return to Sol, when It deemed the soul is prepared to receive peacefully pure and bright *Phos* which It grants to us all as a gift, in its fullness will give us the eternal inspiration, eloquence and senses.

#### 1.1 The Creation

And now I shall begin describing the earliest histories in the traditions of the great chroniclers Apollodoros of Pella and Arseniis of Epikroteia, who diligently recorded the earliest of histories prior to the arrival of Apostle Phaethon and wrote the earliest history of the Tolnars and the Thalassarans. Nikephoros of Kleopolis, who composed a universal history up to the rule of Antiochos the Magnificent of the Batrachid family. And finally the *Deeds of the Giselwaladands* by Degeno of Trufer, the first historian of us. I will follow the example of writers whom I have mentioned and in my turn to reckon these entire series from the obscure creation of man down to our own time.

The world, as it is related, is created from a very dense black sphere, which in turn is filled by the primordial *Phos* [The Holy Radiance]. Within the sphere, the Radiance was constantly moving, changing positions, opening crevice and sealing leakages, eventually the tension caused the sphere to implode and release *Phos* in its fullest energy, therefore creating many unregulated matters. Sol appeared as a natural result of this, because naturally these matters ran their courses into a fixed route, which Sol regulated according to *Phos* and modified these malleable matters into everything we know. The birth of human, like all other types of lives, was a natural result of the world developing according to the sacred Rules of Sol, which demanded that one specific type of life is to receive Its grace and mediate the existence of Radiance, to make it accumulate in individuals in its greatest possible quantity and therefore making it stable, far from the tension-creating form existing in the black sphere.

Sol allowed the world to develop methodically. For the first millenium after the Implosion Sol created two realms, the House of Sol and the World-of-the-days; in the second millennium the sky was constantly shaping and reshaping into a black sphere decorated by Sunna, the Moon, the planets and stars, so that *Phos* is evenly cast onto every corner of Gotha [or Gea] every Sunnan cycle, for Moon and the Stars conveyed mediated, mild and clement *Phos* in the night and even sometimes extending to the day; the third millennium the world evolved with mountains rising and oceans filled; the fourth millennium the world is further carved by the natural forces into what it is known today, with all these hills, rivers, valleys; the fifth millennium the world is filled of lesser lives; and eventually in the sixth millennium human was granted the Holy Illumination and became distinguished from all other lives. Moreover, they also acquired the rein over some of these lives in these years, as they were inspired by Its grace through learning many things, such as hunting, herding, farming, fishing, and many other skills - the gift we call inspiration.

#### 1.2 The First Men

But the primordial men, while on one hand had the potential granted by Its grace and *Phos*, on the other hand were ignorant to the Words of Sol. Despite some Rules of Sol were known to them, they were greatly obscure and venerated instead a Father-Son pair called repectively Ellthonus and Dolzzanius. They believed at first in the sanctity in the thing closest to their form and therefore depicted the two as anthropromorphic beings, but Ellthonus and Dolzzianus in their essence were the residues of unregulated, primordial *Phos*, which Sol always strived to get hold of. From the veneration of the two a deep-rooted principle called *Agon* was also born and rooted indeed in the human being. It seemed to me that many nations often claimed to have been descended from a first pair of people. The Thalassarans claim that their ancestors were Thalassanos and Hellia, signifying the Sea and Sunna; the Himarians claim that the foremost couple was called Adim and Hawwal, which mean a man and life; the Pyrigians claim they are descended from Tarchon and Iulia. For the Gisels it is said that all people descended from a certain pair, Irminaz and Fritha, because they thought the world is created in the tension of profoundness and peacefulness. This, I believe, suggests the existence of a state of multiplicity, and that men of different nation are derived from their respective ancestors.

According to many legends the first men degraded generation by generation, a point which I mostly disagree. Then as men multiplied and began to spread across the whole earth, they were also further divided according to tribes or cities. The tradition of Degeno, who travelled around the land of the Gisels and had collected tales from the old men from many other regions. According to him:

> To begin with, it is generally admitted the Gisels were the descendant of Theudariks and Freuwja, a pair among the many descendants of Irminaz and Fritha. Freuwja bore three sons, called respectively Gunthwodiz, Gislazharjaz and Gaizanaudiz. The mother, observing the sky for three years, then told to her sons an oracle and sent them each to establish a city. The first established a city in the north called *Reudaz Viekuz*, after he bested the best local warriors, who were famous of their red hair; the second, advised by a trader from Tolnaria, picked a very good place on the river of Talbe, which is convenient for either trading or cultivating, and then named the town with the name *Gislaz Viekuz*; the third came to the land of the Awans and was respected by them as a hero, and hence the region he controlled was called the *Halith Viekus*. Then, the apostle Wisaword came to these princes each and taught them the words of Sol, so the Gisels became illuminated very early on.
> 
> Then as the subjects of the three princes multiplied beneath heaven, they also sent out their children to different lands to establish their own feunies. Gunthowodiz sent Alariks, who established Rugiland when he encountered many local farmers cultivating rye; and Redabalthaz, who established a stronghold among the Schwynens; and Knodomeriz, who went to the south, uniting all men there and established Allemannen. Gislazharjaz sent Irminazfridu to the land of trees, Terwingen; he sent Sunnaberhtaz to the west and cultivated Neustland; he also sent Frumoheruz to the region of Magenland. Gaizanandiz first sent Halithbrandaz to the island, which we call Heldeland today; then he sent Hluthawig to the littoral area called Littland; finally he sent Karilwardana to the land of many river coasts, Ripoarland.

This is to say that the Gisels, from their very beginning, are divided into various groupings. There were other interpretations of this origin event. For instance, many claimed the first brother was called Gundowald; Fredframm the Burgener in his *Chronicles* claimed that the three brothers wer descended from a sea monster; Siesnando of Hispalis claimed that these people were descendants of a powerful chieftain, considered a face of Ellthonus very early on, with the name of Mannus, which means a person, or the specific person who led the Leodars'; a later song also claimed that the three brothers were in fact conquered by Waltheri, whose deeds I will describe later.

#### 1.3 About the deeds of Phoster Phaethon

It was approximately synchronous that the Cult of Sol evolved from a branch of Ellthonism. Initially people venerated idols and deemed the nature as deities, but soon these people were attacked by Ellthonists who claimed the deities were to be anthropomorphic and therefore the icons they venerated were false. So after these people converted to the Ellthonic Sol, many indeed felt with a stronger connection with Sol, for they had an abundance of *Phos* in their interior even when they venerated a wrong interpretation of Sol, as It demonstrated its power clearly. And to interpret the Words of Sol, the earliest believers developed various languages. The most primordial of them is called Simorgian, or bird-speech, from the name of an Arzavashian fable about the gathering of birds; then people invented the Welioglyphics, an *Aithos*-bearing word. But one created sacred letters without a Sacred Word, without the necessary discerning of Sunna and Sol, without the explanations about the true form of divinity, and hence came the Phoster Phaethon.

The Phos-illuminated Apostle Phaethon was born in the 1026th year prior to the intercalation to a nobleman called Apollinaris and a women called Virgina, in the port called Hierakleia on the Island of Keldonia. He was taught by certain wise men who came from the south, who gave him a inscribed tablet made of astral-iron, which is very rare and especially precious in its form being rectangular. One day, the young man arose at night when he heard the Radiant Fulgers sent him a message which they said was written on the tablet. After reading the inscriptions, the young man Phaethon set up an altar to a painting of Solar-circle instead of an iconography of Ellthon. The king of Keldonia, called Eleutheros, was greatly amazed and sent some men to seek this thing out, and Phaethon debated against them with perhaps the greatest ever of eloquence and rhetoric, which made them completely persuaded and instantly prostrated in front of him. Later he went to the amphitheatre and made a speech there, while interrupting the play about Dolzzanius there. A certain angry man called Paetos hit him with an axe in his forehead, which wounded him gravely, but miraculously the next day he appeared in front of the citizens without any frailty or scar, which made them astonished and therefore they believed what he said.

But at this time, certain people from Doria with vile intentions accused the Apostle and his followers as Arzhamagian, or mages using vile magic of fire, therefore all their condemnations against Ellthonism were false. But the Apostle debated with them keenly about the fact that the world is composed of the elements, namely water, wind, metal, wood, and earth, and that fire is born from the interaction of Phos with wood, which is facilitated by air and helped by the clinging of metal. This made the men very amazed and they gave up accusing him. There were also two men debating the closeness of Sunna, while one deeming the Sunna is always larger nearer to the horizon, the other argued that Sunna is closer in the noon because the noon is always hotter. For this the Apostle replied that it is out of the intention of Sol to mediate *Phos*, when the unmerciful *Phos* is the strongest It look smaller, while the *Phos* is weaker when It appeared larger, and that for one's eye and skin felt differently, this is because of the balance in the House of Sol.

Then, Phaethon went preaching around every corner of Keldonia, teaching how they were embedded with the potential of Phos, how this demonstrated a divine will, and how this gift might lead one to a peaceful ending. He went to Agothia and Epithalia and then collected many disciples. The Melkthonians were roused to hatred against him, persisting to their Ellthonic faith and striving to unjustly destroy the Just. But at this time Antenor the Old, the King of the Agothians, destroyed their army and sanctioned Phaethon to preach in and out of his country. Therefore he also went to Chaenia, Grecia, and then into the lands of the Hyllatae, the Ippates, before entering Rutilia and the western Caridal regions. It is said that he had 3,600 disciples, 72 of them were the most extraordinary and were therefore also called apostles, and these men spread from the northern Bothonia to the southern Himaria. He died peacefully in the land of the Arebacians when he was 72.

#### 1.4 About how the Apostles Hermund and Wisurd arrived in the land of the Gisels

At this time, as the light of the Apostle Phaethon's teaching spread through the southern lands, it drew to itself many souls from afar. Among these were the brothers Hermund and Wisaword, called by the men of our days Wisurd. These men were merchants from the northern port of Kentowick, of the Awan people, who in the course of their trade had sailed their ship to the city of Motta. There, in the marketplace, they heard the Apostle Phaethon speak, and as he explained the nature of the inner *Phos* and the difference between the material Sunna and the divine Sol, they were seized by his wondrous words. They forsook their trade and followed him for six years, diligently learning the sacred teachings. There they also worked to translate his teachings into the Gisel-tongue.

At last, filled with the desire to bring this illumination to their own kin, the brothers took their leave of the Apostle and began the long journey back to the lands of the Awans. But the path of the righteous is often beset by trials, for the world still held many dark places where the law of Sol was unknown. In a forested pass of the Guleon, their caravan was set upon by brigands. The older brother, Hermund, in defending their meager possessions, was struck down and murdered. The thieves, finding little gold, took the clothes from his back and, most grievously, the book of teachings he carried, before vanishing back into the wild.

And a temptation arose in the heart of Wisaword, for here was Sol's own justice, a righteous end for the wicked. But then, a revelation of the Fulgers came to him, a current of pure Phos that burned away his anger. He understood that Sol’s way was not destruction, but the restoration of order. He stepped forward into the space between the killers and the wolves, and he spoke. He spoke not to the men, but to the beasts, and the words were not of his own tongue, but the primordial Words of Sol, words of balance and clemency. At the sound of his voice, the snarling ceased. The wolves, as if recognizing a higher authority, lowered their heads, turned away as one, and melted back into the forest as if they had been a dream. 

The men, seeing this wonder, were struck dumb with terror and awe. They cast themselves upon the ground before him, weeping and confessing their crime. They brought forth the stolen book, which was in its full length written in the letter of the old Gisels, now stained with the blood of his brother Hermund. And Wisurd, seeing their true repentance, did not condemn them but instead offered them the very teachings for which they had murdered. It was these men, his brother's killers and now his first disciples, who first spoke the name by which he would be known to all the Gisel people.

#### 1.5 About the Foundation of the Church in Awavoordt

Later the Apostle Wisurd translated the remains of the martyr Hermund to the ford of the Awans. There were two large bridges around the town of Awavoordt, as one might have already read from Bertramn of Ockarbeck, that the city is located on the confluence of the Awa and the Ferra. There in front of a bridge he established a little shrine to his brother and taught the converted men there of the words of Sol. He acted as a teacher of Gisel tongue but also the faith, which made many men, who were grateful of his guidance in many matters, devout disciples of Sol. They also called the place Verbrugge and therefore the Apostle Wisurd of Verbrugge. There he acted as a professor and doctor, who taught and cured the illness of many.

At this time also a Himarian called Iaqub, and a Rutilian called Markis came to the place and helped Wisurd to set up a school. They also to Rutilia and then came back with many books, letters and teachings of the other Apostles. But later a roaming band of the faithless Westmans attacked the two pious men and made them received the crown of martyrdom. Hearing this most saddening message, Wisurd then came to the court of King Frotmund's court in Giselwiek. He petitioned him about how two subjects of him living in Awavoordt were murdered by the Westerners, which made the king furious and he immediately ordered the army to march west. The Westmans were expelled from Sundreich and henceforth the merchants could go peacefully along the road to the south.

Meanwhile, as the king's justice secured the roads, a certain nobleman named Gundobert, the *Burcgrave* of Awavoordt, who was a respected judge and a rich man possessing vast wealth from his estates, was moved by these events. Seeking the repose of his soul and wishing to honour the memory of the martyred Iaqub and Markis, he came before the Apostle Wisurd. By a formal charter, he granted in perpetuity to the shrine of the Blessed Hermund the entirety of his ancestral estate at Guntdorf, a fertile land rich in fields and woods, so that the school might be sustained there in their service to Sol. 

Yet this generous gift had one great lack, for the estate drew all its water from the river and had no spring of its own for drinking. Therefore, Wisurd led the new community in prayer for three days. On the third day, he went to a barren patch of ground near the shrine, and striking the earth with the staff he had carried since his journey from the south, he called upon Sol to show Its favour. At once, the dry ground gave way, and from it issued a spring of the most clear and sweet water, which has not ceased to flow to this day. The people gave thanks for this sign, and named the fount Hermund's Spring, seeing in this miracle a sure sign that the blood of the martyrs truly watered the soil of the new Church.

#### 1.6 About the early life of Waltheri, son of Frotmund, and the invasion of the Westmen

The son of Frotmund, Waltheri, was also an ardent student of Wisurd and a fierce warrior. According to Degeno, Waltheri was most ardent in his pursuit towards the knowledge of Sol, but he, like many rulers from this era, began to adopt the name of Invincible Sol, especially when they marched their banners against the infidels. In the 936th year before the Intercalation, the king Waltheri granted Wisurd a very large piece of land in Giselwiek and honoured the new-founded church to the martyrs Jakob and Mark. From there, in a very short time, the old man converted the whole city with his words.

It was at this time the people of western Arcasia were greatly famed. The King Mantokos, who originally carried arms for Antenor the younger, created his own kingdom of Portavia. He strove without respite to match his early triumphs and conquered many states. Frotmund and Mantokos exchanged their eldest sons to their respective courts to showcase their mutual friendship and respect. Therefore Waltheri came to the city Ferharvar of the Portavians while the prince Szarvas to Giselwiek. In Ferharvar met the young prince Etzel and befriended him greatly. The two young men outstripped all other Portavians and made Mantokos very proud. After the old king Frotmund died, Waltheri returned to Giselwiek and then Szarvas returned to Ferharvar.

At this time the Westmen and the Melkthonians raised a large army to persecute the nations of Sol and conquer their people. These men originally came from the sea, perhaps from the Austrisola and Utica, but they pillaged all the way through the continent northwards into the land of Portavia, and then attacked the subjects of king Szarvas there. Their leader, a man called Ur-Milki, also called Wanakas, is said to have benn no limit in his overweening pride. pride. He was the perpetrator of a long series of crimes, being under the influence, so they say, of his wicked mother, and now, as I have told you, he mobilized various infidel peoples, invaded Portavia and destoryed down to its very foundations every single building, which had been put up in ancient times. When he reached Weißburg, called Ferharvar in the local tongue, he set fire to the local granary and caused a great famine in this country.

Later a shepherd and loquator called Pheython, also called Sólyom by the locals, was found by these men when he was preaching among some hogherds and shepherds. This good shepherd was not willing to surrender his sheep to the wolves, and so the Westmen tried to force him to make sacrifices to Ellthonus. Pheython refused to do anything so foul and he made his revulsion clear. Then the Westmen beat him with sticks until he was thought to be dead. Within a few days Pheython died from the wounds of that beating. This terrible affair made the Portavians hugely enraged, and they sent for help against the Westmen to many nations. Then Waltheri led a force composed of Talbelanders and the Sunds to relieve his friend Etzel. 

But en route he was ambushed by the treacherous Sordish King Hludiger, who surrounded him with a large army of the Westemen. Then Waltheri miraculously jumped out of the circle thanks to his horse Donarhuofos, who carried him into a feigned retreat and helped him picked off those who dared to pursue him one by one. Then the Rugil general Thorismund and prince Etzel also came to help him in the fight. Eventually the army overcame this ambush and marched against the Westmen.

#### 1.7 About the War against Ur-Milki

After Hludiger's treachery failed, the King marched against Ur-Milki upon the field of Kastron. Etzel and Waltheri attacked and routed the enemy they faced, but Szarvas attacked the forces of Ur-Milki himself but was defeated and killed. Then the Portavians became more furious than ever and they pressed on with great determination, instilling the hearts of the Westmen with such fear, that they immediately turned around and fled. After the battle the Portavians hailed Etzel king and carried him upon their shields.

Then the army pursued the enemy towards the Samander. According to Bátor of Siófalva, before the second battle was joined, the leader Napas led the vanguard to attack the enemy. Then, when Ur-Milki heard this, he attacked the vanguard and captured a certain shieldman. He then interrogated the rustic man: 'Is the Great Barbarian (*Barbaros Megas*) himself here? How large are his troops?' The man replied: 'The Great Barbarian indeed comes, his army is so strong that you cannot resist.' Hearing this, Ur-Milki was instantly stricken by horror and ordered his troops to cross the river and find a better ground to defend. But the army of Waltheri and Etzel attacked with such great ferocity, that Ur-Milki was routed a second time, with himself slain by a soldier called Helmnot. Therefore the Invasion of the Westmen came to an end.

---

Then, was elected by the other princes a hegemon-king, or *Waldand*, and led a force composed of Gisels to relieve the castle. But after they arrived they discovered the Portavians were alread subjugated by the Thalassarans, and when Waltheri retreated his forces, his general Hludigar betrayed him and surrounded him with a very large force. Then Waltheri, seeing the men of Hludigar and the Thalassarans surrounded him, miraculously jumped out of the circle thanks to his horse Donarhuofos, who carried him into a feigned retreat and helped him picked off those who dared to pursue him one by one, including Hektor. Then the Rugil general Thorismund also came to help him in the fight. Eventually, Hludigar was also killed when Waltheri threw a spear which pierced through his head. 

And later the Thalassaran Basileus Alexandros begame good friend with Waltheri, who called him *koinonos* and *filos*, because Waltheri helped him to attack a pagan people called the Valzi; he also granted him 10,000 Pentadrachm for his service and the title of *Archon*; moreover later he [Alexandros] also gave him the name Antiochos, which is also the name of the famed conqueror the magnificent, and henceforce the leader of the Gisels was called by the name of *Antioker Waldand*. Then Degeno described how the Antiocar Waltheri received many kingdoms under his domination when he travelled to Allemannfurt and convened an assembly there. He then entrusted these princes with dominions and subjects each accordingly, calling them the *vürste* among the men, their subordinates *garafio*, which means those who carry out decrees. The *garafio* then appointed their *liud* and *gisindi* to the various settlements and governed there as the *sculdehaiz*. In return of these benefits, the men were to pay him tribute, participate in his justice and his campaigns. 

The *vürste* them proclaimed the Gisels should have a king, just like the Thalassarans have a Basileos and the Rutilians with their Kings or Consuls, and that the original ruler of the Gisels was called a judge (*Dingman*), also called *kriter*, but now as his dominion grow, he needed a bigger title. And therefore Waltheri and the men raised his son Sigomund as co-king and made the men pledge to be loyal to him and his son Sigomond. Then they also discussed laws, which they had after four old men, called Wisogast, Ewaberaht, Adalrehht, and Gitatrahhar, who helped them to have laws, and they also established many fortresses and towns around the Gisel country. He also appointed *Hofgarafio* in Reudiwiek, Giselwiek and the city of the Awans, Awafurd, so that the kingdom will have three capitals.

#### 1.? The Walthering Line

After Sigomund died, his son Sigorich succeeded and had very long hair to show his unique status, and he settled the region called Angern, which was previously inhabited the Faleners, who, out of the depraved custom of anthrotheism, venerated a certain face of Ellthonus, called Istio. The Istites fought frequently with Sigorich, who eventually conquered their lands and forced them to convert, after massacring their nobles in Minne.

#### 1.? The *Urlagilando*

But according to Degeno, this line of power gradually waned and these kings became do-nothing kings, and that many kings of equal nobility and courage rose up and dragged the whole Giselreich into a period of *Urlagilando*, or warring states. During this period many Gisels also went to many foreign lands and they performed many remarkable deeds, and at this time the name Gisels was known far and wide in the south. These kings, when they saw fit, perhaps because one of them was very strong, also resumed to use the title of Antiocar in an honorific manner. It is by then a certain Hagano, who was at first a *Grave* sent by the king of Mayenau who oversees the district called Neustland, where he served faithfully, paid the king many good horses and silver as tribute, and then attacked fiercely against the Vinnans and conquered their lands. Later, the king rewarded him the region around middle Talbe and named him a *Vürste* among the *Landaldras*, or princes. But after Hagano died, the kingdom of Mayenau went into turmoil and was conquered by the Söstfalens, who weren't able to conquer Giselwiek, which was refurbished by Hagano and defended by his son Walther fiercely. Walther, who was equally brave as his namesake, eventually controlled a very large kingdom and was named *Waldand* by the Talbelanders, the Mayens, the Litts and the Ripoarians.

Charamundas, who collected from many other reliable sources and wrote dutifully as a historian, not only continued the work of Degeno but also commented on many places. Charamundas argued that:

> The Gisels, or Leodarians, I am apt to believe, derive their original from no other people; but from very early on they were mixed with the old Tolnars, also called Pyrigians, and often travelled by land and fleet to many other kingdoms; and especially into the might eastern ocean, settleing many northern isles, but they hadn't reached *Fernord*, also called Septemtrionia, where ice always covered the land and the wind so repugnant and forbidding, so people from our world never enter. Moreover, the Gisels were of settled nature very early, who, benefitting from the convenience of large rivers and flat fields, from then on cultivated grain and rye and sold them to the southern lands.

Charamundas' opinion is also the opinion I concur in, becaue otherwise one would be without any means to explain the existence of Lucanian words in the earliest bardings, for instance one might conflate *Reddar* with *Ekues*, or *Hauptmann* *Kaptaneus.* Charamundas was also apt to point out that it seemed early Gisels were closely related to the Tolnars as he found many Gisel names, for instance Guilelm, Cualtherio, Reginmundo and Adelfunso, were prominent among the Syonese, the Rutilians and the Ialmarians. Similarly, Charamundas also claimed that the Thalassarans frequently came to the Heldish Isles and Uttaland and traded with the Litts and the Ripoars, which is also a commendable point. He also discussed how the Gisels called Ellthonus:

> In their old ballads they celebrate _Tuisto_, a God sprung from the earth, therefore a form of *Ellthonus.* But this tradition didn't exist very long because very early the Gisels were able to read the words of sol through Heruisk, one of the oldest sacred tongues of Sol, similar to Weliglyph or the words of Simorgh, which came from the south in the equatorial land of Media. It is said that Phoster Wisurd to the Gisels was like Phoster Haikus to the Arcasians, both spreading the words of Sol directly from the Phoster-Navigator Phaeton himself. Therefore well before Polydeukes the Just established the church, the Gisels were believers of the Invincible Sun.

Many years after Charamundas died, the Warring States waxed on with larger dominions now annexing the smaller, and these larger states often attacked each other. At some time the Haganonen declined and the Alleman Kingdom, which was ruled by the line of the von Stoufburg kings and acquired the title of Antiocar. However, then the Intercalation took place, which was indeed a most horrible disaster. The Anteans, the Aelethans, the Tonorians, the Sambians and the Valzs invaded these kingdoms from five directions, and because many of these people believed not in Sol but in Ellthonus, a great war happened. At this time also the Lucanians and the Campanians began the first Aithofery, and the Himarians supported them with a large number of *ghazi* warriors and well-equipped *faris*, who then conquered and settled in Longonia, after retaking the land from the Uticans. Therefore the Gisels urged their kings to have a new Antiocar to bear the fire and lead the faithful against these nations, and coincidentally, the Lotharen king Phosbert united his kingdom with the queen of the Allemans, Solgisa, and consequently was proclaimed finally a true Antiocar. Phosbert accumulated wealth, force and a system of state, which helped him cope with this crisis and established a unified state of Gisely.

Many people outside of the country do not even know who the first king of the Gisels was. The *De Gentibus* of Cinatus gives some detail about these people, for he described that the *Leodinones* had a very large town called *Vicus Pigni*, which many though might be Giselwiek. while Parmenion's *Historiai* seemed to wrote them as war-leaders, very likely merely copying how Demetrios Batrachos boasted about how he annihilated 200,000 Allemans with a single charge of his companion horses, except that he changed the army of 'barbarians' into Gisels. However, I personally think the works of Trefoniis Puifis, son of Luvkis, is very demonstrative in this matter, and hence is worth quoting. After he talked about how the Ciburian Consul Fougontos, son of Mollos, conquered the town of Nikaeans, which was the precursor of the city of Nizza in our time, he adds:

> At that time, the Bothonian leader Eburonicus invaded the Tolnaric cities on the Syonese coast. He first sacked Amperlo and then attacked Rivaltum, before then moving against Parvenium. Many of the inhabitants were slaughtered and they ravaged the most fertile areas. Terrified by such atrocity, many other cities, like Epikrotea and Lassadium therefore appealed to Fougontos, who dispatched a certain chieftain, a *socius extraordinarius* who came from the stock of the Franks and the Gisels, called Ratagostus, to reinforce these cities. These people acted bravely and dutifully, just as the names *Francus* and *Giselus* shown, and repelled the Bothonians with great ferocity. Afterwards Ratagostus returned north of the Altino back to his homeland.

In Book II, when he described how the Uticans sacked Parthenope, he says:

> When Mago and the Uticans marched northwards, he sent the generals Abirami and Hanno with an army collected against the Ciburians. The King of Trema and Spalatum, hearing about the march of the enemies, rushed forth to help their friends. Hanno, who would brook no delay, urged Abirami to immediately attack this coalition and restore all payments which the Utican King gave to them to win them over from the Parthenopese. And they should also surrender any Parthenopse hiding in their cities, because these people were according to him warmongers responsible for a violation of peace and committed idolatry against the Great God Ellthonus. The Rutilians refused and challenged them in a duel. Abirami therefore sent a bodyguard sworn two him called Galba to challenge the Rutilians, who, after discussing the matter thoroughly, picked some men from the mercenaries before finally chosing a certain swordmaster (*magister enses*) called Mellobaudes, son of Voltimnos, whose mother was a Gisel slave. Mellobaudes then challenged Galba most eagerly and ran him through with his sword after they exchanged several blows and frequently hit each others' helmet and shields.

From here, it is clear that Trefoniis described the Gisels as a group of mercenaries, who frequently served in the Cirburnian army. These were also attested by Degeno, who says that royal leaders of the Gisels were often called by the Rutilians Franks, because they thought they were brave, responsible in service, and used throwing-spears very well. He also recorded a general called Radagast, who, according to the tradition in Sordland, served first the Ciburnians and then Campanians, and thereafter he went to the Ialmarian Isles and served there. His son, called Regino, or by the Campanian name Antonius Radagasianus, was a legate of the general Epetos Oustiou of Nizza, who was later defeated by Polydeukes the Just.

Some times later, the geographer Philosthenes claimed differently, that 'the people of Thiudonia, also called Leodary, never to have mingled by inter-marriages with other nations, but to have remained a people pure.' This opinion, though wide-spread, is utterly false, as we have clearly discussed in the text before. He also claimed the Gisel lands east of Markia was full of 'gloomy forests and marshes,' which is again, seemingly not based on any sources. One indeed might question how this famous geographer composed his text. The only point one found Philosthenes commendable is that he correctly identified that the name 'Phrankoi' came from 'the word *Phramm*, or *Phranko*, which means a javelin.'

Thalassaraios of Thalassara, who seemed to have read the work of Charamundas and was familiar to both the Helds and the Gisels. When he writes about how during the war between the grandsons of Antiochos Batrachos and the Portavians, the latter captured and laid waste to Chaeaia, he also writes the following:

> Meanwhile, at this time Respendial, the King of the Red Portavians, withdrew his forces because he heard some Franks led by Godogiselos came across the Samandros and pressed his dominions hard. When Respendial then attacked the Franks, in his army there were some *Thiudonoi*, who defected him because of the proximity of their language and customs to the Franks. And then the two armies met on the field of Kalautanos, where Respendial lost twenty-thousand men. At this time, the Franks, also called the Gisels by their historian Charamondos, looted the baggage train of Respendial and then moved into his duchy, afterwards they sacked several Portavian towns, including the rich emporium Gyulavar and Mortis Wasara. Bultusu the collected a large army to help his kin and destroyed the Frankish army, killing their leader.

This event was also recorded by the later writer of the *Book of the History of Vinnans*, Tassilo of Vigenberg, who explained it in a more orderly manner:

> At this time, [Hrudopert] the *Marckgrave* of Vinnen, seeking to increase his favour with the Antiocar and expand his land, decided to attack the land of the Portavians. At first his *Vizegrave*, Thoidemer, advised him not to do so because he thought the sons of Mantokos were strong, but Hrudopert was more persuaded by a certain merchant called Memnos, who claimed that the Portavians were planning to settle in Thalassara and their fertile lands will be left vacant, so Hrudopert hastily drew an army and commenced an attack with Thoidemer and his brother Hrudorihh. At first they indeed met no resistance, and the leaders became very arrogant and falsely believed the enemies had already ran away. Then near the town of Zsiolasburg, they encountered a very large army led by Bulko the leader, who ran the army through with a multitude of horsemen and killed all three princes.

Therefore, the historians not from Gisely often give us information about the Gisels, but they always failed to recognise where the Gisels from or which king these Gisels belong to. And then many of their written hearsays are not to be believed.

## Book Whatsoever Idk
### Jahr 244 nach die Interkalation

Right after Winter Solstice of the last year [243 P.I], the Army of General Herr Fulrad [von Kukenhoben] secretly planned a surprise attack against the Portavian garrison of Salzach, as the enemy believed they dispersed into wintering and would not resume the siege. Some of the Lisnen soldiers pretended to be Uckerani who wished to surrender to the Portavians and entered the castle by night, while some others scaled the wall secretly with ladders and overwhelmed the sentinels with ease because of their number. Then a battle in the courtyard followed. The enemy commander, called Csongor the Tall, as well as another leader called Elemer the Centurion, were slain in the battle. Among the Gisels, fifty men including Captain Herr Krothart von Kellen, from Kullenstede in Rugilland, were also killed. Upon hearing this, Roga [King of Portavia] was greatly dismayed, because he himself and his bodyguard were still staying in Ennsbruck, without a force at their hands. Therefore, after ordering his son Bela to remain in Ennsbruck and command his forces remaining in the camp, he secretly escaped from the town with his advisors and then rode back to Fehérvár. But with Roga leaving, the leader of the Campanian contingent, Messer Emillio Stratioci also decided to leave because he was angry about his ally [Roga] didn't inform him this and considered his troops were placed in a very dangerous position, therefore he, after informing Bela about his decision, also withdrew from Dusser.

Despite entering the new year with a victory, the Gisels were more worried than happy because the health of Antiocar Lothar III was deteriorating day by day. For he, without an heir, appointed the general and Colonel-senior Herr Reccared us Quadenburg as his heir, a nomination confirmed by his cabinet. The old Antiocar, suffering from one time stroke and this time a serious cough, long before this day told his friends and servants that death, as if by some kinds of messengers, had announced signs to him. Finally, when his painful ills combating each other and sapping his strength, the weakness of his condition took its toll. He felt very ill when he was reading *Geography* of Bertramn of Ockarbeck in the palace of Fulgerheim, and then was taken by the servants to his bed, and in the final days before death came across the doorstep, he distributed his possessions in writing just as he wished. He finished his last day and left an almost unbearable sorrow to the State of the Gisels. He lived for 54 years and was the last of the von Lotharen line. His death caused immense trouble for the Gisels not because of a lack of competence, but because many men of similar courage, nobility, and prestige acted out of their own interest rather than prudence and loyalty to the state, forcing Reccared to deal with them one by one.

For there is always one thing worse than one might expect, because as last winter a great church council took place in Mayen, disputing about whether the *thelema* of Sol was clement or not. The council was presided by the Colonian legate Guillermo da Savona. Archiloquators and loquators from both Gisely [or Giselreich] and foreign lands like Thalassara, Vitunia, Sambia, Motta, Rutilia, Palesia, Longonia, Heldland, Arcasia, Aelethland, Pravenia, Ialmaria, Sillingia, Antea, Himaria, and even delegates from many other distant lands. The delegates of Tonoria and Portavia protested to the Pontiff of Colonia about picking Gisely as the location and decided not to be present in this council, despite its ecumenical nature. At first the council discussed the matter of setting up schools in Misuia, but many rejected this proposal because they didn't wanted reciprocity, and that they were deeply worried about the heretical Salvationism rampant in meny rebellions of the said country. The council then became a quagmire of endless disputation and defamation, with parties assailing each other by inventing non-existent opinions and points of view. From what I have read from the compiled tracts and notes, the major argument was around Loquator Castorio of Palesia, who proposed that the Three as well as Moon acted specifically with a clement will to help connect the World-of-days to the House of Sol, but his enemies, namely Archiloquator Heliophilos of Pella and Thomas of Luntport, accused him of falling into the heresy of *Eleophysitism*, while Castorio and his men attacked them of being not explaining Sol according to *Liber Solis*, and causing the debate to shift to a contest about the nature of the Book and the Intercalation. Meanwhile, Doctor of Theology Omar daw'Aleanbar and some fellow Longonian loquators, as well as Theubert van Basten, Bohuta of Monscutna, John of Eastburgh, and some other clergymen, also contended the matter of equal capacity of *Phos* among every individual as a grace of Sol, which was neither rejected nor refused because many delegates weren't prepared or ready to talk about this matter. 

Other matters were also discussed in the council, for which solved a long-standing dispute between the Archiloquators of Minne and Trufer. The incumbent of Minne, Ambrosios, fabricated documents and tracts inserted in the loquatorial history, that then he compiled a well-documented codex and presented to the Antiocar to certify his claims to the loquatry of Magenland, including certain privileges and *Urkunden* granted by previous Haganonen, Stoufen and Lotharen rulers. He also acted haughtily as if this evidence was true and good. However, these false compositions were pretty much artless, because they didn't follow the form of such texts, nor were they using proper calligraphy. Moreover, some of their claims even extended to Mayenau and Nordmark, which were obvious statements of their insatiable greed and power-lust. But some of the Truferan Archiloquators also forged documents to prove their claims, and the two parties accused each other of infidelity, which made Lothar III very annoyed and he therefore pushed the matter to the vindication of Colonia. And eventually the legate judged that the district falls into the jurisdiction of the Archiloquator of Trufer instead of Minne, which made Ambrosios of Minne hugely enraged. The legate also appointed, with the consent of canons and loquators from Sillesen, that the new Archiloquator of Apennlau would be Solfried, who was the original deacon of the seat. I will not include many other issues discussed in this council in its entirety, for one should consult the compiled records themselves.

Meanwhile Reccared, who was at the time serving as the Marshal of the West, was residing in Allemannfurt and participating a judicial assembly of *Krieszog* Herr Warmund von Hober of Allemannen. First, a messenger relaying from post stations informed Reccared and Warmund about the death of Lothar, which made them very sad. After a few days, the high-chancellor Heinrich of Strappel, the imperator Herr Sebast von Aliuswald and the chamberlain Willigis of Magenen, as well as many other men holding cabinet or palatine offices, came to him with the regalia, guarded by the *Vedertrager* wings, informing Reccared of this most saddening affair, so that he would promptly know about Lothar's death and not in any way delay his own arrival, and that they were afraid of being accused of planning something sinister against the new Antiocar. They also brought with them the will of Lothar and declared him the Antiocar according to it. Then the Antiocar and these men moved east onto the *Heinrichsstraze* to return to Giselwiek. As Reccared, having entered the region of Pfalztalbeland, was approaching the city of Lorisheim, Hatto the syndic, and Eigilbert, the loquator of the city and a man most learned in every subject, perceived the reason for his coming and anxiously sent a messenger as quickly as possible to Reccared to learn just what he would command him to do, whether to wait for his arrival in the city or to meet him at some point along the way, as he was coming to the city. Reccared understood the reason and told Eigilbert to come, because he was afraid of spending too much time on the road. 

There Reccared also received another messenger, who had come to him from Awavoordt, about the death of *Kreiszog* Herr Koenrad van Floristad, and the Utts were yearning for leadership. He shared his condolences with the Awan, telling him that the person will soon be appointed by the court, when the matter is thoroughly discussed in the cabinet, and then met Hatto and Eigilbert in person, and after two days he moved on entering the valley of the Horle and then another day's march along the roads took him to Giselwiek, concluding a six-day journey. When he came to the gates of Giselwiek, many thousands of officials, nobles and Gisels received him with great favour and declared him Antiocar for the second time. He gave sincere thanks for the burial of Lothar, who was buried in the Church of Sun-in-rags with other Antiocars of the Gisels, and he brought solace with fitting consolation to the servants and officials of the palace, who were struck with bitter sadness. For after the reading of Lothar’s will, nothing remained of Lothar’s goods that had not been shared out by his plan of division, since nothing had been left unbequeathed by him. And then an extra grain ration was distributed to the burgesses of Giselwiek. He also made the following arrangements of offices: the cabinet incumbents remaining were High-chancellor Heinrich of Strappel, the High-chamberlain Willigis of Magenen, the Senior of Admiralties Herr Karl von Dennewitz, the *Gewritszog* Berthold of Oche, and Archiloquator Hartmann of Helgenau remained the *Aprokrisier*; Herr Ekkebold von Danau was appointed the Colonel-Senior, Herr Haitnand us Markomeren was appointed Justicier-in-chief, while Friedlieht of Wehmen was appointed the Chief Fisc-manager. These appointments were passed by the colloquia after discussion.  

Later the Antiocar received the embassies dispatched to the state. He listened to them diligently, dined them elegantly, and sent them back laden with sumptuous gifts. The most important among them came from the Consul August at Thalassara. The *protospatharios* Antigonos Arekolios, the deacon Basil Lekapenos and the envoy Michael came to him to reply to everything written to the brotherly-ruler in Thalassara. The Antiocar also sent loquator Amalrich of Serterp and abbot Ignaz of Eliwerf to Thalassara with the returning envoys, seeking to renew the former friendship and peace.

Despite the matter of succession is discussed by the top officials of the state, there were still significant uncertainties to many who hoped the old Antiocar might change his mind eventually. Some of them supported his illegitimate son Lothmann, but Lothmann refused them sternly because he, as a man content with his life, was happy that he remained as the judge of Giselwiek, plus he finally inherited the Lotharing villas around Talbeland. Arnolf the Bastard, who was Lothar's illegitimate brother, seeing his nephew had no intention of taking the throne, decided to make his own moves, because he himself thought the Antiocar's position be passed to the next closest in blood. While he previously discussed the matters with many men, including the old Antiocar Lothar himself, the Hich-chancellor Heinrich, the *Kreiszog* of Mayenau Lauwebold von Oosthaim, as well as many other administrators and officials, but these people all urged him to accept the Antiocar's decision, which is Reccared, who was as experienced a general as Arnolf, perhaps even with more reputation, because he contended frequently on the most dangerous western and southern frontline, and previously served in the cabinet. But Arnolf was no less prestigious. Having served various positions, including the sheriff of Griepshoben, the *Kreisoberist* of Angern, the Commander of the Life Guard, and eventually the *Kreiszog* of Angern, Arnolf's ambition was fuelled by his competence at various positions, all he lacked was a cabinet appointment, which his brother never made, because he himself perhaps was afraid of the accusations of nepotism. Once there were petitions to made him the Senior of Admiralties, but Arnolf, after weighting his inexperience with naval affairs and his reputations, refused the naming after it was passed by the colloquia. Arnolf, a man who was not only a competent planner, but extremely clever in carrying out his schemes, possessed of vast wealth (no mean asset in one who aimed at a throne), with the prestige of royal blood and of success in some former wars, with many of the regimental commanders at his side to help on his enterprise. But at this time, he pretended to be loyal and also went to the Antiocar himself, while secretly planning a coup d'état behind. 

Antiocar Reccared then turned his head to other affairs. First, he appointed a member of the central army-advisory Maarten ver der Stappen as the commander of the Giselwieker garrison, because the old commander Herr Bernward [von Mostert] was of 61 years old and desired to retire. Colonel Maarten previously served in Ermelo effectively against the Mottan pirates and then in the advisory to the cabinet, which made him a trusted adjunct of Reccared. He also appointed Ruudulf von Huissen to the Utts as the new *Kreiszog*. At the same time, he personally met king Gustav of the Corusian Isles, who wished to continue his friendship as a client of the Giselian State, and presented a well-crafted Orichalcum sword to the Antiocar. In return, the Antiocar also granted him trading privileges in the ports of Hammo, Huotorp and Wehmen. In late-Hornung, Antiocar Reccared now decided to field an army personally towards Sundarlaund to retake the city of Ennsbruck. But just as the army was gathering, the *Stadtgrave* of Giselwiek, Warnar [von Burscheid], with his brother Ingobert and nephew Lantbert, gathered a small horde of men and attempted to fight their way in the Castle of Königsberg, his motives unknown, because people knew neither his previous misconducts nor his grudges against the Antiocar or his predecessor, so perhaps he was driven by his ambition of taking the position of the antiocar himself. But he was supported by none other than his cronies, which made this affair very strange. These men were then deemed criminally liable and imprisoned by Maarten and other men, because they dared to show weapon illegally in the capital and attack the garrison. After some time the Antiocar ordered Warnar, who conceived this plot, to be ran through with a sword, while the others deprived of their eyes as punishment. After the matter had been settled, the army departed Giselwiek.

However, seemingly enticed by the action of Warnar, Arnolf became very eager and decided to launch a coup d'état, which soon found considerable support. Clearly he had plotted for some time before the death of Lothar III and distributed his wealth under the guise of providing to the poor. Therefore, on the 18th of Langez, Arnolf instructed his son-in-law, *Kreisoberist* of Angern, Robert von Puinnen to convene a council of military affairs in Lümborg. There, Robert openly declared that he was loyal to the cause of Arnolf, who should be rightfully ruler after Reccared had dutifully acted as a regent', whereby the colonel Herfried of Hammo immediately objected and protested loudly to his superior, yet Robert ordered him to be detained and a day later had him secretly killed and thrown into the Reitha. Ambrosios, still recovering from his fury at Mayen, and always desiring to expand the jurisdiction of his see and siphon more cash, while constantly being jealous to his fellow loquators, received some promises from Arnolf and also agreed to support his cause. Other main supporters of Arnolf came mainly from Magenland, Nordmark and Rugiland, because he himself had many clients in these regions. Some of them, for instance Gundsalvo us Flaund, who was the *Kreiszog* of Rugiland, supported him because Arnolf promised him a position in the cabinet, and that the Flaunds held immense local grudge to the family of Reccared. Some, for instance the Liudger von Hauden, *Markgrave* of the North, was cut-off from the capital and forced to comply nonetheless, especially because administratively many storages and barns where the Nordmarker garrisons acquired provisions were located not locally but in the more developed Ostfalen. Warmund von Hober remained on the fence, out of the proximity of Allemannen to Rugiland, but the *Kreisoberist* Gotthard of Inden openly defected with two regiments of men, which forced Warmund to flee southwards from Allemannfurt into Sillesen. But the other three regiments remained under either in Wirtzburg or under the command of Herr Fridurich von Pilten, the Marshal of the West. But when Arnolf wrote to the other lands, like Sordland, Mayenau, Horschen, and many other prefectures, he received no response.

Therefore, whether out of fear, or out of grudges, or out of fickle loyalty, or out of ambition, many men assembled under the banner of Arnolf, who was then proclaimed by his men Antiocar. Moreover, Arnolf also used his vast wealth to hire some mercenary from the northern isles, led by a certain Ingvar, who is said to have led 5,000 men and previously served in the Himarian army as a mercenary guard, whom they called a 'Sikalaber'. Later many men from Magenland, northern Littland and Ripoarland, including retired veterans, gathered to Lümborg to hear the Anti-antiocar out, either out of their fear of his cruelty, or out of their admiration of his fame, or out of their desire of his rewards, or simply having no faith in the state at all. Thus Arnolf ordered another regiment of men to be assembled. He then declared in a speech to them, as he himself ordered these to be distributed in written forms across the cities he ruled, promising he would strive to renovate the Giselian state. Then, with this force, Arnolf purged many loyal servants of the State and distributed these offices to his followers, or simply to rich individuals who bought the position from him. He even promised many of his followers the positions of inspectors and sheriff in districts he did not control because he was so confident about winning. 

Then the Flaunds sent officers Egica and Chintafred with a troop of 2,000 horses, whom he levied from various localities and equipped them with good or bad steeds, across the river Elsa into the region of Elsland and then Ripoarland, plundering peaceful towns and scorching villages in the manner of brigands. Afterwards, the troop returned whence they came with many booty. The grain and gold they captured filled many carts, which slowed the march greatly and used up many pack horses. Seeing their column marching slowly on the road, the sheriff of Vorriporaland Adelhard von Tarrn and the captain Radwin von Lupfurd, thinking about emergency measures, assembled some local garrisons and the *Landwehre* to pursue these looters, and they attacked and destroyed the baggage train of this column, and the loyalists prevailed. They took 200 heads, including the head of Chintafred, who was found to have been hiding in a cart of hay. Yet the main forces of the rebels remained in Angern because Arnolf deemed the season is not suitable for campaigning and instead wanted to wait for Spring.

Unbeknownst of this, Reccared still proceeded with his men first west and then south, but when he reached Lipsk, he was informed of this by messengers and faced a dilemma, because just at the same time, local unrest broke out in Lisnen. When he moved to Oksburg and met there some representatives from Lisnia, including the Sheriff of Lipsk called Herr Ota z Balzec, the Sheriff of Daleminz Herr Zbinec z Lewinsky, and the Sheriff of Busina called Arnost of Milik, these men complained to him about how the local notables of the Uckerani, out of the number of their people and out of contempt to other Lisnen citizens, wanted to expand their borders and annex Ramenetz and many other shires. They even desired to be transformed into a new prefecture, or perhaps better a feudatory, to the state. However, there also arrived some Uckerani led by the previous Sheriff of Poschetz Waldomer, who accused the Businans and Dalemincians transgressing the boundaries and the Uckerani were forced to rebel to protect their own liberty and peace. Then a very fierce argument happened and the Antiocar ordered the two sides to temporarily stop because they had done so for the whole morning. 

However, when Reccared and his follower left for the meal, some followers of Waldomer, seeing this as a chance of punishing their opponents, as if they can freely feud even when the Antiocar himself is present, flooded into the council building and had the other officials and delegates violently beaten up. Ota of Lipsk, who defended himself by stating the peaceful intention of he and his companions, was thrown by these men out of the window and broke his neck. The burgesses became very angry, seeing these people who should have been their guests now neglecting the laws of the state and sowing discordance in the city, and because a defenestration happened so recklessly without any regard of local honour or public order. The mayor Friduric the Merchant and his guards surrounded the building and demanded a negotiation, but then a certain Uckerani from the building shot a bolt of crossbow which hit the helmet of a guard. Friduric was outraged because these men even dared to bring weapon into the council building in such a manner, and then with his men attacked the Uckerani with clubs and swords. The Uckerani were not adequately equipped compared to the guards, but they did used various obstacles to block the stairway and shoot arrows down the windows. But the burghers attacked furiously and eventually broke in and killed all of these men, and only the adjunct of Waldomer, a certain Stoinev was left alive because he was to be interrogated.

When the Antiocar returned, he angrily asked what happened just as the grievously wounded Arnost was carried out of the building by some of the burghers and the monks of the hospital of Phoster Januarius. The mayor and sheriff Zbienc, who escaped thanks to his position closer to the door, then came before the Antiocar and related the matter in full. The Antiocar, having heard this, commanded the aforementioned Stoinev to be brought before him, who at first claimed that Waldomer was merely defending his honour, but the Businans and Dalemincians humiliated him with vile words so he decided to feud against them; however, as Zbinec cleared this accusation, then Stoinev confessed that Waldomer was already convinced by other Ukranians that his plead will not be heard, and that he only wanted to resort to violence and to use his own death to provoke the Uckerani. When this Stoinev was asked about whether Waldomer was associated with any sort of armed rebellion, Stoinev replied that he knew nothing about these militant actions even after interrogation, so that his words were believed true and good. Stoinev however did claim that the Userians and the Uckerani who followed judge Priebtschek of Koldow had secretly planned for a rebellion for a long time. Nevertheless, this Stoinev was then transferred to the urban court and being vindicated to be hanged due to murder. 

Thus the matter in Oksburg was settled, but not the empire. After this affair, the Antiocar realised his position was greatly unstable, and that he could only rely on trusted personnel, because he now faced a war of various fronts. First, he ordered his brother Ermengild to lead an army back to Talbeland to defend this region from the incursion of possible enemy attacks, because he couldn't ignore the imminent rebellion in Lisnen, nor was he sure about the Portavian army's position. He therefore decided to be personally present in Allemannfurt with a part of the state army to stabilise this region, because this will greatly stabilise the regions in the west, and that he ordered the troops of the western regions to be mobilised from their barracks respectively, because he was uncertain about defeating the enemy when a large part of the *Ostreich* followed Arnolf. When he proceeded to Allemannen, many people from various parts of the *Westreich* flocked to him, so that he convened a large popular assembly in the city of Elm, on 14th of Bluome. He first rewarded the officers and officials who remained loyal to the state, not to the rebel Arnolf. He also repremanded Warmund, who gave up his post and did not oversee his subordinate and allowed a defection in his prefecture. Therefore Warmund was deprived of his title as *Kreiszog*, replaced by the former *Pfalzgrave* of Allemannfurt, Welf von Waltheren. Herr Liuvimer us Roggenhof, the *Kreisoberist* of Rugiland who brought with some loyalists, including some infantry and two wings of cavalry, was also accepted into the army. There, he also ordered a tract to be written and announced, which I include as following:

> In the name of Sol and Its indivisible *auctoritates*, the *Erstelioht*, the *Wächtar* and the *Lumpensunne*.
> 
> Let it be known to all Our faithful men—to the prefects, loquators, abbots, generals, sheriffs, and all the people of Sol entrusted to Our care—how Arnolf, once a general of this state, stirred up by a diabolical spirit and swollen with pride, has forgotten his divine ministry and has broken the sacred oath of fidelity which he swore to the state before Sol, the Three and Its holy Phosters. He has presumed, with damnable audacity, to raise the standard of rebellion against the will of the former Antiocar Lothar, which is conveyed to Us by the faithful members of the cabinet and recognised by the procession of the Gisel people. Contemning the divine order, he also allowed the Northmen, those wolves, to prey upon the flock of Sol, and has made pacts with foreign powers, thereby disturbing the peace and concord which, by Sol's grace, it is Our ministry to uphold. He has become a sower of discord, a lover of sedition, and a manifest enemy of the justice of Sol.
> 
> Therefore, by the counsel and with the consent of Our men here assembled, and by the authority which the divine guidance has conferred upon Us, We declare this Arnolf, and all who willfully adhere to his perfidy, to be enemies of Sol, of Holy Church, and of the entire people of this state. They are perjurers and traitors. All offices and stipends which they hold will be revoked by the state, and their persons are subject to the judgment which the law prescribes for such faithlessness. We take up arms, therefore, not to satisfy Our own anger, but to restore the justice of Sol, to defend Its holy churches, and to cut out this wicked sedition from the body of the faithful, lest the whole be corrupted by its contagion. Let every faithful man of Sol prepare himself, knowing that in this cause, we wield the sword not for worldly gain, but as ministers of the Unyielding Sol, to punish the wicked and preserve the righteous. May Sol Itself grant us victory.

Meanwhile, when spring arrived in Bluome and Winne, the army of Ermengild engaged the vanguards of the enemy in many skirmishes. At first, some of the Antiocar's advisers, like Heinrich the High-chancellor, believed their cause to be hopeless. On second thoughts, however, they changed their minds and the whole affair took on a different aspect. This is due to the fact that Ermengild fought very bravely and that might be a worthy opponent for the rebel, and to them this Ermengild represented a safe anchorage, a shelter from the storm of rebellion, and a man who previously served first in the navy and then in Vinnamark against the Tonorians, being vastly experienced. This man Ermengild, according to the historians, reminded people of his grandfather, the general Hugo, for he was always wrapped in gloom, and watchful, comprehending and analysing constantly. Far from being ignorant of warlike manoeuvres, there was no aspect of skirmish warfare, no trick of ambush nor tactic of pitched battle, in which he was not thoroughly versed. In the matter of physical prowess, moreover, Ermengild was more energetic and virile than the old man Arnolf. Many claimed that anyone who received a blow at his hand was a dead man straightaway and whole armies trembled even when he shouted from afar. I however considered these words panegyrics with certain amount of truths. However, he did achieved many victories in these skirmishes, either out of his bravery or out of the courage and integrity of his cavalry.

And now I shall turn to relate the first battle happened in this civil war. Then general Ermengild met the army of the pretender Arnolf in the field, near a town called Taunsien, who is very confident of his forces and ordered his men to attack head on in full force, with both cavalry and footmen, because he believed that he had but to stretch forth his hand to seize the Antiocarate. The two armies, which were alike in training, equipment and command, fought with great hesitation because they all knew very well their opponents' valour and discipline. They made many small skirmishes and probing attacks, but none of them engaged wholeheartedly. But the fight between the wings of cavalry was more chaotic, as usual for mounted combat. And then the two men, by common consent, decided to engage in a duel. So, riding out to the space that divided the two lines of battle, they spied one another and without more ado came to close quarters. But Ermengild, without greeting with his sword, stepping up suddenly, delivered a very powerful thrust with his longsword. Arnolf, despite dumbfounded at the unexpectedness of this stroke, which hit his breastplate very hard, then fended off his next slash with a strike called master strike, simultaneously landed a blow from the right with such power on Ermengild's helmet that he momentarily lost control of his veins, while fending off his attack with the cross guard, thereupon Ermengild lost interest of fighting and rode back to his men. Then, seeing his left wing was on the brink of breaking, Arnolf ordered the men to retreat, so that despite failing in a duel, Ermengild still controlled the field and proclaimed himself a victor.

But soon, as Ermengild pursued the enemy further north, his victories became ephemeral and his strength weakened, it seemed the defeat had taken its toll on his spirit, like a young wolf defeated by an older one. And his apprehension soon developed into anxiety and rashness, which conquered his mind, making all instructions from Reccared forgotten, and he decided not to delay but to gamble a decisive battle. He also ordered the capital garrison to march out against the enemy, an order he persuaded the imperator to make. Then, on the 22th of Brach, the two armies met at a place called Breitveld, where the loyalists were utterly beaten because Ermengild and his horsemen pursued all the way into the enemy baggage train without realising that commanding a wing of cavalry is vastly different from commanding an army. Had not Maarten ver der Stappen led a valiant rear guard action against the advancing Alemanns, the army would be destroyed. In this battle, both sides lost more than two thousand men, but Ermengild became increasingly agitated not only because of the enemy, but also because Maarten, whom he called to his side as the garrisons of the capital were also marching with them, seemed cooler than ever when he took the field. Moreover, because the message of his defeat eventually reached Reccared, the Antiocar considered his options and ordered his command to be relieved, and he was to be assigned to Salzach as a garrison commander. 

Ermengild felt greatly neglected because his ambitions appeared to be slipping from his grasp, and his lost of command of the troops made him felt greatly humiliated. Therefore he openly complained to many that this treatment was undeserved, when he was riding with some of his men towards Salzach. Disgruntled, he and his followers, including the captain Donarmund von Udonen and the loquator of Ruhrgau Heinrich, transferred secretly across the borders to Tonoria. They rode very quickly because they are only a hardened band of men. There he made himself known to the king Segtiu II, because the king Segetiu always planned to weaken the State out of his obligations to the Portavian king Ruga. Now Ermengild, away from the State of the Gisels, rode with his men to the grand harvar to meet king Ruga, who planned to make him a foil to the Reccared. He then not only married his niece to Ermengild's son Hugo, but also handed him the command of the troops of Istvan and Cuintul, as well as a hardened band of Poartavian mercenaries, led by his trusted lieutenant Dominik of Szomos. Thus Ermengild departed again from Portavia, not as an anti-antiocar but as a vassal, a foreign instrument, who pitifully bowed to a foreign ruler to maximise his own strength in the contention of the antiocarial office.

At the same time, the Antiocar finally brought with him the soldiers from Sillesen, Allemannen and Obertalbeland east again into Pfalztalbeland. But before all of the campaigning, he convened a very large assembly in Giselwiek, because Ermengild's actions weren't unknown to him after a month, when time has alread ran its course into Hewi. He and the cabinet officials condemned both pretenders again in front of the colloquia and also drafted many administrative orders. First, the representatives of the colloquia passed an emergency war tax to fund the war efforts, as Gisely was now embroiled by a large civil war. The tax is passed without obstruction, except by a certain Markian representative called Oriliu Tuscul, who always voted no if the incumbent Antiocar refused his petition to raise his individual stipends and pension, especially because everytime he claimed that delegation was both consuming his body, his mind and his purse. Some days later the other two Markian representatives, namely Salvian Marcellul and Antoninu von Ragnesti, clearly embarrased by their colleague, advised the Antiocar to promote Oriliu as the new church advocate of Regnesti, because the old advocate Cornel was already eyeing his retirement, and the Antiocar complied with their petitions. Later it is said that he enjoyed his life of *otium* running the church vineyards there, but he sold poor-tasting wine - 'In vino veritas!' This matter was related to me by Salvian's son Iulian. Second, the imperator ordered the reserves, the *Landwehre* and the veterans in Uttaland, Littland, Obertalbeland and Mayenau be mobilised and put into service in new regimental units. A total number of 12,000 men was planned to be raised, armed and trained accordingly. Thirdly, the Antiocar also sent to Heldland a delegation led by the *Gewritszog* Berthold of Oche, because he wished the Heldish King to remember their traditional friendship and honour the defensive pact and sent reinforcements to help the Giselians fight against the enemies.

Meanwhile, Ermengild and his men moved into Markia and then Schwynen, before they moved into northern Allemannen which was still swayed somewhat by the enemy because of its closeness to Rugiland. When he arrived in Haferfeld, he convened a small council with his close followers. Heinrich the Loquator advised him to temporarily give up designs on the throne himself, since he was in no position to take on both the Reccared and Arnolf. Ermengild then indulged himself in an outburst of insolence at the expense of the former, and announced to his troops that he was to present himself to the latter in the guise of vassal. And hence, on the first of Hewi, he appeared to many as the newly appointed *Kreiszog* of Sundreich, who temporarily also commands the military affairs of Schwyn, Lisnen, Markia and Greutmark, with the charter of Arnolf in his hand. Then Ermengild sent many letters to the regional military commanders hoping to find help. Out of these men, only the Uckerani from Lisnen, led by their leader Jasomir and Peschek, appealed to him because they long wanted to dominate the whole region at the expense of other Lisnens; others, led by the Marshal of the West Herr Fridurich von Pilten, as well as the forces of Fulrad in Salzach, remained in their position because they feared that the Portavians might launch another campaign against Greutmark, Lisnen and Sundreich.

After Reccared assembled his forces, and time ran its course into Aran, when wheat was already ripened for harvesting, he moved to besiege Hilmessen, because this junction controls the *Nordenstrasze* into Angern. The siege, starting from the end of Brach, that is to say the 29th, lasted for some days before the syndic Hildward ordered the city to surrender, because they were in no position of defying the Antiocar. Arnolf moved his troop with great confidence, because he defeated Ermengild and considered his opponents to be minuscule, as he intended to besiege the fortress of Dietmund in lower Talbeland, and hence force his way to Giselwiek, but found the fortifications well-prepared and the commander Herr Willhelm von Valkenwald most determined to stop him. He assaulted the fortress for two days without any success, and his adjunct Gotthard of Inden was killed when he was scaling the wall. Arnolf woudln't wait his siege machines to be constructed or built, because he realised that the loyalist movement into Angern was very dangerous to him. Therefore Arnolf decamped and moved again eastwards to attack the Antiocar's troop around Hilmessen. Arnolf also ordered the army of Ermengild to march south.

On the 7th of Witu, just as the two armies were moving along the fields and roads of Gisely, a violent earthquake struck most of northern Chaeania, Arcasia, and by extension Uttaland. The church of Phoster Diederik in Turnveen collapsed and the Loquator Gisleif as well as many of the functionaries perished in this horrible disaster. May them return to Sol happily! On the same day the judge of Brempolders, the worthy Angilpert Goldschmied, died of old age. This man was a descendant of a family of burgesses not unknown in those days, for instance the syndic of Heliwerf Helgaud and the captain of the Awavoordter Regiment Richard were all from this stock, and Floris the *Kreiszog* deservedly held them in high esteem, because of their civic contributions, donations to the poor and the school, and many other charitable deeds. With Gisela van Heelo, this Angilpert begot the deacon-magistrate of Koelne, Weishard. Angilpert was buried in Heelo, whose church he funded in honour of Sol and Phoster Januarius, where I governed as a priest most faithfully for many years. Here he ended his life happily and was laid to return to Sol in peace.

It is reported also by this time a group of Rutilians led by Siginolfo da Corisa entered the service of the Palesian duke, Uvis the Bald, and defended the town of Pales against a horde of Portavian armies led by the Duke Szolomon of Durosh. The siege lasted for four months beginning in Bluome, and eventually Szolomon's forces were repelled by the defenders valiantly, because they assaulted the city without much success. Eventually the Nizzans sent a fleet and prompted Szolomon to lift the siege. In this battle the archiloquator of Pales, Rumis, who had just returned from the council of Mayen, blessed a catapult which destroyed three of the Portavian catapults. The men were shocked and called this catapult The Fist of the *Wachtar.* Siginolfo and his brother Giustiniano and a thousand *venturieri* they commanded fought with great courage and demonstrated great excellence in the weaponry.

Now I shall return to the course of history from this little vignette about a disaster and a worthy family, not least because the rival Antiocars weren't informed by this horrible event at all in their respective armies. I will now write about what I read from various journals, reports and other tracts about their confrontation, but not at its greatest length, for this battle, just like the battles preceding in this little book, was very well-documented by many writers. I will, therefore, treat this battle in a concise manner fitting of historical writing. 

So the Gisels, when they took Hilmessen, held a council of armies to decided whether they should move further north along the *Nordenstraze* into Angern. The Marshal of the North, Herr Sunnagar von Holzburg advised the Antiocar to move towards Hebestede because the town is a junction of the *Nordenstraze* and the *Talbestraze*, and therefore a path the enemies must pass by. The other commanders agreed because now they possessed a strong army of 18 regiments and 16 wings, which was of approximately 36,000 infantry and 13,000 cavalry. Because they possessed this large force, and that the generals estimated the enemy forces were no greater than 14 regiments with a fitting number of horses, based on the message that Ermengild was sent south with a significant force, the army of Reccared was confident of meeting the enemy on the field. This, however, was greatly wrong, as they neglected the sheer number of mercenaries Ermengild brought with him from Portavia and Tonoria, so that Arnolf only sent him a token force instead of a portion of his army. 

So the army moved their camp from the city of Hilmessen to Nürnfurd, which is of two days' march north from Hilmessen. From there some spies and outriders were sent to find out where the enemies camped, because Sunnagar believed a strike on their camp might be devastating. Certain Angerner, dressing up like labourers and servants, were also discovered spying on the army and therefore detained. When these men were caught and brought before him, Reccared didn't planned to punish them, as is the usual practice, that on the contrary he ordered Colonel Maarten to attend them and point out clearly the exact arrangement of the camp. After this had been done he asked them if the officer had explained everything to them with due diligence. When they answered that he had done so, he furnished them with provisions, and told them to report carefully to Arnolf what had happened to them. On the following morning at daybreak, the outriders returned and reported an enemy contingent, perhaps dispatched by Arnolf, was moving towards the town of Ramsloog. They also reported to him the terrain in front of the army, which then helped the commanders to decided the battlefield. Reccared, hearing this, arranged the Colonel Haistulf of Trufer to lead 4,000 foot and 2,000 horses of the Littlanders to probe their position.

Just as the forces of Haistulf departed, which was in the afternoon of 15th of Witu, some other outriders, as well as some local Angern men, reported to the Antiocar that the enemy camp was very close, but it lays north of their position, not west. Sunnagar claimed accordingly that the enemy dispatch from the northwest might be a reinforcement, and argued for giving battle immediately. Reccared, on one hand ordered the men to rest in the camp, on the other hand sent some groups of horses to probe the enemy camp at night to estimate their numbers. He also disptached many messengers to Haistulf to order him return hastily along the roat to a village called Bohledorf, which is northeast of the field he picked, because he hoped that Haistulf's troops can appear on the back of the enemies. The midnight was tense as many soldiers and officers weren't able to sleep, some were afraid of participating in a battle of fraticide, some were worried of their cronies or friends, who served in the regiments in Angern, Nordmark, Harsaten or Rugiland. So the next morning the army departed from the camp, leaving the baggage train behind. Reccared led the army open to the field in front of a manor called Ioannisberg. Then he deployed the defence as following: first, he ordered a contingent of 2,000 foot and horses commanded by colonel Maarten to capture the north-eastern village called Uhgosberg and defend there. He also deployed a regiment forward towards a walled manor called Heiligehecke, led by Captain Arnwijk of Umpteda. After an adequate number of reserves was selected, the main body of infantry was then arrayed between this two points, and the horses commanded by Colonel Herr Willhelm von Haxthausen. protected the left flank. The right flank was deliberately left open because the position of Uhgosberg was quite forward and the terrain on the right wing was rather ragged. The first line of the centre was formed by the Talbelanders, commanded by Colonel Messer Marco Cittadini, while the second soldiers from the south, commandead by Colonel Herr Liuthard von Hapsbaurg.

Having made these preparations, he rode along the lines and addressed his troops in a few words suitable to the occasion: 'The faithful of Sol-Victurus! Bear in mind your past battles and fight like brave men worthy of yourselves and your country. If we overcome the enemy, praise the Sun-in-rags, then this brotherly war will end, when the viper's head is cut off from the body. Now that Sol offers us a chance to restore peace and end the bloodshed, how utterly craven, in short how foolish shall we be, if we reject the greatest of goods and choose the greatest of evils from mere love of life. Go, therefore, to meet the foe with two objects before you, either victory or death. For men animated by such a spirit must always overcome their adversaries, since they go into battle ready to throw their lives away.'

As the Antiocar himself was resting for a while in the shade of an ash-tree atop Ioannisberg because he was already quite worn out as much from riding as from bearing his arms, messengers of the vanguard came to him and informed us about the outriders of the enemies were seen. And hence the army of Arnolf formed up from their camp. The army of Arnolf reached 70,000, but included many hastily levied men or poorly trained *Landwehre*, which he placed in the first line to use, as if these people were expendable. He also maintained a large portion of his horses in reserve because he realised that he cannot outflank the loyalists by charging his horses upward onto Ioannisberg. 

But before the battle began, the Antiocar decided to offer his enemy a chance to repent their faults. For this he sent the syndic Janso of Hammo and the auxiliary-chancellor Poppo to this task. But the men of Arnolf, rudely humiliating the two envoys and jesting the envoys of cowardice, sent them back not with good words but with a crude axe. Since the Sassens received the men with such an offhand and scornful manner, the Antiocar became enraged about this whole affair and sent another crier to the enemies, saying: 'You underhanded cowards and rogues, go tell your master, Arnolf, that Reccared, Shepherd of his people and servant of the Unyielding Sol, does not pay tribute to oath-breakers and rebels. We have come not for strife, but for justice, to end this bloodshed you have begun. It is not our doom you see before you, but your own. Prepare yourselves, for today the ravens of your banner will find a feast not of our men, but of the prideful traitors, who aligned themselves not with public good but with foreign interveners and barbarians, and falsely used the holy name of Sun-in-rags, who will ensure a certain proper ending for themselves! If you are to repent from this, immediately leave the army of this man, who led your paths astray!' Some of Arnolf's men became very impetuous because of these words, shouting brute and vicious words and fired many arrows to the crier, who rode of quickly from these dangers; others, as if the word touched them by heard, slowed down as if they were reflecting the words.

At about ten o'clock, Arnolf commenced a furious attack upon the defenders of Uhgosberg. The battle raged on as Arnolf sent the Allemans and the Magens to attack this farm, but their attack was repelled. Some of the rebels charged into the farm, but then the defenders closed the gate and utterly slaughtered them. Then, the mercenaries led by Ingvar attacked impetuously in the centre. Because many of these Sikalabers had once served in the bodyguard of the Longonian Emir, the prevailed against some of our men by their courage and skill, but the Talbelanders held the line admirably, relying on their orderly formation of halberds and spears and the superiority of their arms. The rear ranks of the Gisels followed close on their comrades, cheering them on, but the enemies behaved like cowards, never coming near their mercenaries nor attempting to back them up. But then Arnolf repeatedly charged the centre with combined arms, sometimes on foot, but sometimes with horses and foot together, sometimes with horses alone, but these attacks were uniformly unsuccessful, because the Talbens maintained their formation tight, and the horses supported them timely. Every time when the enemy attacked with great force, the loyalists countered with their cavalry reserve in time and pursued the regrouping rebels repeatedly. The *Glevener* and *Prodomer* from Talbeland highly distinguished themselves, attacking bravely with lances and swords, beating off the enemy horses and capturing maniples of soldiers. At this time, Reccared also learned from a messenger that Haistulf's force might arrive later in the afternoon, as he engaged with a significant number of enemies and routed them, and now he was marching back as fast as he could.

Ezzelin von Ezzonen, the Commander of the *Vedertrager*, despite leading his men valiantly and captured two regimental standards and many soldiers, was killed when he charged into the enemy ranks. Captain Hatto of Saalebrügge of the *Glevener* wing of Dietmund was also slain. On the enemy side, the cup-bearer of Arnolf, Heribert von Behren, the Chief-colonel Helmut von Heuna, and the *Apokrisier* loquator Edelhard of Norendorf, were killed in the melee. Among the ranks of our men, a man called Eumenes from the Life Guards proved most able as he killed Gundsalvo the traitor with his halberd slamming through Gundsalvo's helmet. Eumenes' father was a Thalassaran but he moved to Giselwiek as a son of a merchant.

The battle raged on as the enemies could use more reserves to stabilise their attacking efforts. At this time Reccared acted with great generalship and bravery. At one time he urged the frontline soldiers to carry on and maintain their cohesion. At the next moment he was at the rear of the army, shouting encouragement to those men who hung back; he reminded them of the cause for which they had taken up arms, *id est* for the justice and concordance of the State and for the righteous path of Sol is followed. Hence strenuously he performed the duty of a general. While on the other hand the Angerners were left in the reserve by Arnolf, perhaps worried or perhaps wanted to wear down Reccared's men gradually. But the battle waxed again because eventually some of the Angerner regiments were sent to confront the tired Talbelanders. Both sides rotated their troops to rest. After the battle had in this manner continued incessantly for five hours, the generals began sending messengers as if they had many more of them to search for the men who should have come.

Just as Reccared was making up his mind to commit his cavalry reserves on the left, he and his advisors, on Iohannisberg, saw great smokes and sounds of movement from northwest. At about five o'clock in the afternoon, Captain Heinric van Brugeldam's second regiment of Awavoordt advanced into Bohledorf and attacked the enemy rear with great force. Some minutes later, the forces of Haistulf arrived from the direction of Bohledorf but attacked directly southeast against the main enemy line. He immediately ordered Sunnagar to lead the cavalry to charge from the left to support Haistulf. The tired Rugilens were defeated utterly and they were the first to turn around and give up the field. At the same time, Reccared ordered the centre to advance and to pursue with the greatest ferocity possible. The attack suceeded at every point and the pursuit lasted till long after dark, and then discontinued it only on account of the fatigue of the troops, who began engaged for ten hours. It is by this time the enemy general Wichmann von Possel arrived with 4,000 foot, which was indeed the force the scouts discovered and Haistulf pursued, but they realised the main battle much later than their counterparts. Wichmann and the enemy leader Robert von Puinnen defended valiantly, and both were slain in the rear guard action leading a group of foot sergeants from Ostfalen, then who surrendered with their captains Roland and Reginold of Appen.

At this time, the General of the Nordmarkers Loukas von Hanenfeldt and his captains Adalrich von Treskow and Lothar von Lindow and two regiments of the Nordmarker soldiers remained in reserve and stayed on the field, but they neither drew the sword nor turned their back. These men argued with each other fiercely and then marched towards the Antiocar, but instead of launching an attack, they sent the commanders as their legate to surrender, because they themselves were forced to join the rebellion out of the position of Nordmark and the later ambition of the *Markgrave.* The Antiocar, out of his mildness and the consultation of his men, commended their eventual loyalty and then announced that the two regiments were discharged from service, but soldiers who volunteer were welcomed to stay. He also ordered the commanders to be relieved of their posts temporarily, but allowing them to leave freely and without harm, under terms that they would not resume hostilities with them, nor would they betray the him again to an anti-Antiocar. Then he ordered these soldiers to give up their weapons except for those who wanted to resume their service, and such men should gather around the legate he sent, and the men should decided which regimental banner they wanted to preserve.

The army also controlled the camp of Arnolf, with a large portion of his personal wealth which he brought with the army. This included a large gold goblet, which is of Xinulian origin; a small collection of books, which he probably read; a bronze mirror allegedly crafted by Bothonian craftsmen; a very large clock; many Mark, Groschen and Pfennig; a set of false regalia, and several box of Chienchowese tea. The money was confiscated and then distributed to the soldiers. The scripts and many written documents of his chancery was also captured and sent to the archive. It seemed that Arnolf was more confident of his victory that he brought with him all sorts of necessities to start government, right after the victory which he yearned and believed that he would have.

A little later, when the army controlled the field, the Antiocar returned to the camp amidst shouts of congratulation from the footmen and the officers, as is the usual practice. He was cheerful and glowing with joy because he had subdued his most dangerous enemies in a notable victory. Everywhere the soldiers were boasting loudly that they had killed some or other of the foremost princes of Angern with their own hands. When, however, on their return to the battlefield, one of them found that his father or his brother or his kinsman or someone bound to him by any tie of relationship had fallen in battle, or served in the opposing army and might have been killed, all joy turned to grief and song turned to the voice of those who weep. The whole camp echoed with wailing and shrieking. They spent the following day in the same camp and covered the slain with earth. They sent back those among the dead who were more illustrious and more wealthy to be buried, each in the land of his origin. They cared for the wounded and they sent those whose wounds had rendered them unfit for military service in future to be cared for by their kindred in their hometowns. It was not easy to calculate how many thousands had been killed on this side and on the other in that battle. Yet the chancellor and the judges worked this arduous task and claimed that among Reccared's men, 3,000 were killed and many more wounded, and from only the heads counted we had more than 7,000 heads cut off from the opponents' necks. More than this number [7,000] of men also surrendered, and many more were captured or wounded.

After the battle ended, as Arnolf realised the disintegration of his coalition, to the grief and distress of the men of Reccared, he ordered Ambrosios to personally impose an over-hasty sentence in front of the men convening in Lümborg of *Unbesprechung* on Reccared and anyone who dared to support him, without summoning any other canons, not even naming an Aprokrisier to represent the institutional church in his now broken government. Moreover, he stated that, lest anyone should accuse him of having, contrary to canonical capitularies, assailed his compatriots, the archiloquator said that he had received a secret letter hidden in a set of vestments sent by the legate Guillermo himself to cut the men off from the words of Sol by a lawful anathema without any delay or discussion required. No sensible man, however, could be unaware of the principal purpose of this measure: namely, that from now on Arnolf would henceforward wage war on the loyalists more readily and more confidently in the belief that killing them would not be any guilty. In this way perhaps for some time Arnolf seemed to reinvigorated himself, drawing soldiers from the country and giving them weapons from the storage, urging them to fight for the cause of renovating the state, and handing out many scripts of future payments in terms of future taxation. Some men, encouraged by his promises, did appear and gave him a false hope of fielding a second force against Reccared. From now on the men who had enrolled in Arnolf's army were no longer divided in their loyalties, but either because they were still persuaded by his charisma or had everything against Reccared altogether. every one of them was a declared rebel. Arnolf showed great endurance as a rebel, for he dined with them on the same table, inspired them with his own determination, reconciled their differences, drank from the same cup and called them by name, and therefore by his flattery bound them to his allegiance.

But more generally, one shall say his general support wavered because now his ability and leadership was proved false by the trial of the Battle of Ioannisberg, because while these people were previously not persuaded by the claims on bloodline, but all the other rationales which I have already discussed before, now they recognised his failure and deemed him not a ruler with wisdom, courage and the discipline to rule as a proper ruler of the Gisels. Arnolf was however working the hardest against these odds. He spent Winume recruiting and training, he rode with a hardened body of horsemen and announced to them that he is fighting a war of mobility and raids, in effect he and his small army now became a body of his personal bandits opposing Reccared with every means. He and his men went across the damped and marshy lands of Halsaten and organised many raids against the Halsateners, because he wanted to terrorise them and, to some extend, revenge on the Nordmarkers because he deemed them with the crime of infidelity. But these actions didn't last long, as the ground became tougher and the waters freezed in Herbist. Moreover, he realised some raiders from the Kibberians also frequently crossed a border, and though he defeated many of these parties, he thought that his manpower was valuable and cannot be wasted fighting meaninglessly like such.

Therefore, after a discussion with his subordinates, Arnolf himself  was nowhere to be found in Angern, because he and Veremund, the brother of Gundsalvo, as well as some of their followers, entered Rugilland and then Burgenland. Along the road they torched lands and scrambled any food they can get. At first they thought they might escape through Halsaten to Aelethland, but they thought that king of Skandeza [Aelethland] would probably capture them and send them back to Gisely in shackles, so these men, greatly distressed, thought Ermengild might be their final anchor of hope, but not knowing his relationship already with the Portavian king. Ambrosios, however, escaped via the sea by a ship into Solisterra and disappeared from our knowledge altogether, and hence this person was nowhere to be found in any sort of records. After knowing his disapperance, the Antiocar ordered the local churchmen to elect a new Archiloquator of Minne, but this wouldn't be done after thorough discussions, so no person was nominated in 234, and many wished the legate personally preside over this matter. But the son of Arnolf, Giselscaz, who was by then a young man and perplexed by his father's decisions, retreated with a small band of men into the castle of Tuliborg and defied the loyalists for a long time. However, at last Giselscaz was betrayed by certain guardsman called Wanilo. One the siege came to the fourteenth day, when it was not the shift of Giselscaz to lead the men at night, Wanilo secretly went into the bedchamber with some of his conspirators and killed him. But then after Wanilo opened the gates, he showed the head of the young man to the loyalists and demanded the Antiocar to pay him a handsome gift, of 10,000 Mark, in the manner as if he was a foreign leader demanding ransom fitting the position of Giselscaz, but Reccared said he wouldn't pay even a Pfennig to a mutineer and ordered Wanilo to be hanged accordingly.

When the Antiocar, after destorying the other loyalists of Arnolf in Sostfalen and their strongholds, in late Herbist marched into Angern, a great many of men, either official or administrator, or themselves a gentry or a poor man, locked to see him and recognised him as the real and sole Antiocar, whether they were oppressed by Arnolf or simply fickle in their loyalties. The first among these men was Frankmut of Gölich, the sheriff of Herusen, and Herr Wararecht von Lennep, the sheriff of Ostwessel, and Michael, the judge of Borcken. Similarly, the men from Hebestede, Comlar, Sugamber, Reudiwiek and many other towns also sent their syndics, mayors to the Antiocar. Some also sought to certify certain charter with the Antiocar, which he ordered the auxiliary chancellor Helisachar to deal with these petitions and then diligently dealt with all other numerous paperworks. He also ordered his troops not to plunder the lands of Angern, and while some banners of his men did do so, he ordered them to be decimated as an example. The next day the king took his seat to receive the Angern in the middle of an open and level field in the place called Spier, where he invited these men to review his troops. There came many men, including the loquators Wezilo of Harnstede, Bucco of Hemming, Berengar of Starfels, and Friedbert of Geisiche; as well as the aforementioned sheriffs and more, including Sizzo of Bornwald, Edilo von Katlenburg, and may other lesser men, from the ranks of the *Junker* and the *Meier*, who either because of their family or the splendour of their wealth stood out among the people. He first discuss the matter of administration with these men, and then he publicly rewarded those who performed bravely in the battle with befitting honours according to the *Heerschild.* He then ordered Herr Willhelm von Haxthausen and Folcmar of Widderstal to remain with a regiment of foot and several units of loyal local *Landwehre* to garrison the castle of Hasenburg temporarily. After hearing from the Angerns, he decided finally that the sheriff Herr Folkwin von Dreven, because of his renowned mildness and prudence, and that he was named by many other prominent men and officials of Angern, should be appointed the new *Kreiszog*, while then he with the men in the army worked out that because Arnwijk of Umpteda performed well as a regimental commander in the battle with utmost responsibility and courage, that he should be appointed the *Kreiszog*. Finally the men gathered entertained themselves in a great tourney, in which they exchanged blows and studied the art of *Fechten*, especially of longsword, which was greatly fashionable. Unsurprisingly, the man Eumenes from the Life Guards bested many other men and won the day, a wonderous feat which, added with his promotion to a *Reddar* some hours earlier, indeed was a finest moment of a man. Thereafter he was known as Herr Reddar Eumenes von Ioannisberg, and resumed his duty in the Life Guard.

While the fugitives Ermengild and Arnolf still gathered some mercenary force, they found themselves fighting into winter and the mercenaries were unwilling to fight a battle. But similarly the loyalists also spread into their wintering, after the Antiocar settled the matter in Angern and moved his troops west into Rugiland. While the Antiocar found the lands of the us Quadenburg family was confiscated and distributed to many men, he talked to these men each, either bought the land back from these men with a payment from his own money, or allowed these men to attain these lands, or allowed the men to feun these lands from the state with a rate the same to any other feuning tenants in Rugiland. He also met with the abbot of Dominus-Sol, Sindared of Barralem, and heard gladly that the men of Arnolf did not resort to desecrate his own family mausoleum in the abbey churchyard. He then re-signed the charter concerning abbey lands which suffered from various civil disorders brought by the civil war. The Rugils also came to him in a similar manner to the Angerns, and therefore the Antiocar magnanimously allowed them to retain their positions and discussed with them administrative matters. He appointed Herr Rechila us Turdeta as the *Kreisoberist* and Herr Aigulf us Elhdburg as the new *Kreiszog*, after consulting the Rugil men. However, one specific man was deprived of his office and stipends and was kept for trial. This man, called Herr Fruela us Wadasto, was accused by many actively using the prerogative of taxation granted by Arnolf and actively extortionated the Rugils, because he himself changed several numbers on the tax script and the *Urbar* of collection, so that he can corruptly siphon a large number of Marks into his own possession. He also put down several bands of resisting peasants and *Meier* and persecuted those *Junker* who refused to comply by ravaging their lands; he also levied feuning cash from tenants to the state, violently beat up some *Schulze* who defied him by defending the customary script rendered by the locality or certified by a charter. This Fruela was then executed after a judgement. Therefore the year 244 ended inconclusively, as the rebellion didn't end, despite having been defeated by the Antiocar in person in a bloodshed, or a pitched battle, within the people of Gisels.

### Jahr 245 nach die Interkalation

The Antiocar celebrated Winter Solstice in Mette without much festive spirit, as he was extremely worried about how the matter escalated, especially as he missed the chance to destroy Arnolf all at once, because the opponent of him possessed the cunning of a military commander and defied all invitation to a field clash, but instead moved with the greatest mobility possible. But Reccared had more to worry than this, as the Council of Mayen ended inconclusively, or one should say, in a total failure. Indeed the concerns of many was not addressed, for instance about the matter of the human capacity of accepting *Phos* and the questions derived from it, namely, the patronage of schools and the election of canons. This matter, demanded by the reformer Gualdo of Pressania, was constantly neglected by several councils, which deemed a more pressing  matter was to discuss the problem of divine *thelema*. I shall say the lack of effective leadership led to the future schism.

At the same day of Winter Solstice, Dr. Theubert van Basten, a canon and chorloquator in Awavoordt, out of his great disappointment of the council of Mayen, and out of his scorn to many of the clergymen who participated and did nothing, and also out of his belief of Dr. Omar's theses, delivered a most shocking and fiery speech to many commoners, burgesses, *Meier*, reddars, and so on. At first the syndic Arne brought with him a large number of guards to see if they should capture him, and the local loquator Dieter van Heym also gathered a mob of his followers, seeking to silence him all at once, but the syndic's men clashed with them head on as he [Arne], often clashing with the loquator, accused Dieter of manipulating his following and disturbing the civil order. Therefore when the two groups of men and women assailed each other with many vile words, Theubert nonetheless made his speech in the Square of Phostra Marca:

> Citizens, good men and women of Awavoordt,
> 
> You hear the clamor in your streets. You see the guards of the syndic clashing with the followers of the loquator. You hear whispers from the west of armies marching against armies, of Gisels spilling the blood of Gisels. You see a disaster and the collapse of the church. You see a state torn asunder, a people divided, and you ask yourselves: why has this calamity befallen us? Some will tell you it is the ambition of Arnolf. Others will blame the pride of Reccared. But I tell you, this war, this strife, this chaos in our streets and in our fields, is but a fever, a violent symptom of a sickness that lies far deeper, festering in the very heart of our Giselreich!
> 
> For years we have been told that the path to Sol is a narrow and treacherous one, a path granted to those who claim themselves to be inherently superior in their *Phos*, who claim to have possessed more divine light as if it is inherited wealth, who jealously denied you from judging whether who should lead the rites and who should not. And yet what did they do? They quarrel! They hoarded wealth and acted as if the destruction of the Church of Invincible Sol was not a lesson, as if the Intercalation was not a lesson. I speak of the great council at Mayen, from which so many hoped for solace and guidance. And what did this grand assembly of Archiloquators and legates produce? Did they seek to heal the wounds of the faithful? Did they labour to clarify the sacred words of the Liber Solis for the humble soul? No! They disputed over the boundaries of their sees, like greedy landlords haggling over a patch of dirt! The legate of Colonia, that peacock in his gilded cage, presided over a marketplace of vanities, not a temple of Sol. They speak of jurisdiction, but not of justice; of tithes, but not of charity; of their own authority, but not of the solace that every soul craves from the Three.
> 
> They would have you believe that the very grace of Phos secured their position, so that they can falsely use the authority granted by the Three to do anything other than leading their flock and guiding them to the proper reuniting with Sol. For this they claimed that, not because of the robustness of mind or the hardship of studies, but because inherently, the light of Phos shone more into their heart, than the yard of a burgess or the field of a farmer, so that you, because of your allegedly less Phos, is not able to admonish and correct what you see is not virtuous and fitting! And moreover they claimed that the Intercalation is not an event of mercy, but event of violence, which prompted them to conclude that, to achieve a Second Dawn, one must accept their depraved customs and imposed order, to contribute to their chests with a thousand of Marks, to gift them a fountain of Groschen, and more - so that they can cultivate their wine, to buy off privileges and obtain monopolies, and to waste the good intention of good men and women!
> 
> Therefore I come to you to propose otherwise, that the Second Dawn shall never happen as it is a lie which degraded Sol's division and devises into a farce; I propose that the Four operates with a coherent, clement will which is to help one to achieve one's capacity of Phos, to reflect and transform the unmerciful raw Phos into the true grace, of inspiration, sense and eloquence, which is inherently equal in its potentnial, and not inherited; that we shall have a Church governed by a council of learned and responsible men, who are loyal to the cause of the state and willing to incorporate these into a unified body, who are with their civic duties and responsibilities, not as thieves of contributions and charitable donations; that we shall have a Church of Gisels, with its canons studied and elected from the Gisels, rooted in our soil, speaking in our tongue, led by shepherds who live among their flock and share their hardships and their hopes. Let us overthrow the false Pontists!
> 
> When we are united in a true, direct faith, a faith of the people, then and only then will we find the strength to heal the divisions of our land. May the Four grant us peace clemently, verily and happily in faith.

With the speech ending, the crowd cheered powerfully and an alderman called Gerhard the Clothier immediately called the men to
