...

In the name of Sol al-Qadir, the All-Seeing, the Source of All Light. My journey began from the Fajr Isles, my home, where the sun first touches the waves of the Avgian Ocean, which we rightly call the Ocean of Dawn. With a fair wind granted by Its mercy, our ship sailed southwest, leaving the familiar scent of coffee and spice behind. The captain, an exellent sailor Zakariya Yahya b. al-Siraj of Qustinah, led the ship with great dexterity. For weeks, we saw nothing but the endless blue of the water and the unchanging gold of the sun, our course guided by the stars and the wisdom of our captain. On the thirty-first day after leaving Qadis, we have came to the Island of Smaller Himaria, surrounded by many other beautiful islands like jewels on the crown.

Our first landfall was the port of New Garnatah, in the land of Rummania. The name itself, an echo of a city in our own ancestral lands, brought comfort to my heart. The Island of New Garnatah is inhabited by numerous people, the land is exceedingly fertile with sugarcanes and indigo and, from its namesake, pomegranates. It has numerous harbours on all sides, and the harbour of New Garnatah is especially wide and safe. The city is divided into several districts, housing perhaps ten mosques dedicated to al-Qadir. The first district is called the port of al-Mansur, in honour of the great al-Mansur b. Kamil, the first emir of this city and a man from our Fajr islands. The harbour is surrounded by huge pieces of wood and an entrance like a gate, which is only opened with the customs officer's permisson. In the city are fortresses, one of which I entered. There were many bazaars inside it. They use the dirhams minted locally with the permisson of lord Malik of Rukkah, but because of the abundance of loots and mined silver, the dirhams of New Garnatah is larger than that of Rukkah.

Despite reminiscences, New Garnatah was a rougher, wilder place. The city is built of sturdy timber and local stone, nestled in a deep bay. The Himari tongue is spoken in the markets, but with a harsher accent, mingled with the words of the native peoples and the Yalmarians. Here, our brethren have carved out a thriving domain, their faith a bulwark against the vast, untamed continent at their backs. As the explorer Piri Reis wrote centuries ago, this land is indeed blessed with wild pomegranates. I saw them growing on the hillsides beyond the city walls, their red fruit like jewels scattered upon a green cloak. The venerable emir Hasan b. Ubaidallah, a descendant of the first settlers, showed me great hospitality. He was educated in the mosque school of al-Maqdinat and Kufah before returning to these western isles. There I also met the famous magister Qarlush from the town of Tolosa in the country of Siyunia. We spoke of the Law and the Prophets, but I noted the local customs had taken on a certain local character. They are a practical, martial people, their prayers often offered for a successful raid or a strong harvest, rather than for the esoteric knowledge we cherish in the madrasas of the south. 

Master Qarlush remarks: "They are good followers of the Light, but their gaze is fixed firmly upon the earth, not the heavens. They are worried more of pirates than the Second Dawn." Later, I stayed in his house and met qadi Isa b. abu Inan, who had said many good words of the Commander of the Faithful in Rukkah.

From New-Garnatah, we set sail further southwest, joining a Yalmarian merchantman for the fabled kingdom in the land of Qutanari. We crossed vast alluvial plains, watered by great rivers flowing from the northeast. Soon, the ground began to rise, and we entered the foothills of the Rayanic mountains. The air grew cooler, the landscape more severe. My Himari companions spoke of these mountains with a certain reverence, calling them the 'Spine of the World.'

...

The crossing was arduous. The peaks here are jagged and formidable. Yet, upon reaching the western slopes, a strange sense of familiarity struck me. Though the vegetation was different, the very shape of the rock, the way the wind cut through the passes... it felt like a continuation of the mountains we had just traversed. As if they were two parts of a single, immense creation of Sol, now separated by the plains.

Descending into the Suyu lands was like entering another world. The wildness vanished, replaced by an order so profound it was almost unsettling. Terraced fields clung to impossibly steep slopes, irrigated by a network of stone channels. And the roads... the roads were a testament to an imperial will, straight and paved, marching relentlessly across the landscape.

After many weeks, we arrived at the capital, the heart of this great empire. It is called Ayacucho. When I asked a local official the meaning of the name, he looked at me with his dark, unreadable eyes and said, 'It is the Corner of Souls. It is where all who have served the Sun and the Son of the Sun come to rest, their spirits rejoining the Great Light (Inti).' I was struck dumb by the poetry and power of this concept. A capital city not named for a conqueror or a victory, but for the final, sacred destination of the soul.

The city itself is a marvel of engineering, built at a breathtaking altitude where the air is thin and sharp. The buildings are of massive, dark stones, fitted together without a speck of mortar, so perfectly that a knife's blade cannot pass between them. There is no ostentation, only an overwhelming sense of permanence and power. On the walls of the great Sun Temple, sheets of that strange, light metal, the Colcuintium or Sun-Silver, gleam with a soft, internal luminescence, reflecting the ever-present sun. Here, in this silent, orderly, and deeply pious city, I felt I had reached a different centre of the world, one that worshipped the same Sol, but through a lens of stone, duty, and the quiet promise of a final return.
