# Don Sunyer Lluis de Illumat-Marti: *Description of Viridian States in the p.I. 320s*

Translated by Prof. FHHS[^3] Jeremy Hutchinson of the Lighthouse Inistitute.

The Misuian king is thirty-eight years and some months old. He is of noble stature, taller than his retainers, and as handsome in complexion and shape as a man can be. His address is very agreeable. He speaks Misuian and Chiencowese tongues, and he studies Chancery Luquanian from magister Mansur, but he pronounces in his Longonian way, instead of the standard, ecclesiastical way. He has read many histories of Chienco and Misuia, and profited by them. He is well read in the texts of about the Way-of-Sol, and is lectured by magister Mansur about the Unyielding Church's ideal of the Second Dawn.

He is, however, only ruling when his two most important adjuncts agrees on his ideas. The first is the *Shogonus*, which one may call a *magister militum*. The *Shogonus* is the leader of the martial ranks (*ordo bellatores*); the second is called *Campacus*, which one may also call a *comes nuntiarius*. The *Campacus* is the leader of the civilian ranks (*ordo magistrorum*). He divides his states into various provinces. His officials carried out his will from the palace. They reside close to the capital and relied on advocates to govern their demesne lands. Many of these advocates, however, came from the martial ranks and were rebellious.

The king resides in the capital city, which is named *Kyo*. It is a place of considerable size, built upon a grid plan that speaks of a discipline and order one does not readily associate with the somewhat chaotic administration of the kingdom. The residents live in houses usually with only a single or two storey, unlike the limestone and concrete buildings of Barcinona. The streets are wide, and many are lined with willow trees. The houses of the great families of the *ordo magistrorum* are vast compounds, hidden behind high walls of white plaster and dark wood, their entrances marked by heavy, tiled gates. One rarely sees the masters of these houses, but one often sees their retainers, clad in robes of dyed silk, moving about the city with an air of quiet importance.

The Royal Palace, which they call *Gosho*, is in the northern part of the city. It is not a fortress in the Giselian or Lecipian sense, with high stone towers and crenellations. Rather, it is a sprawling complex of wooden halls and pavilions, connected by covered walkways, all set within meticulously raked gardens of sand and moss. Its defences seem to be more ceremonial than practical, relying on the sacred authority of the king rather than on walls of stone. It is said that the king performs daily rites to the Sol, facing west towards the direction of not only dawn but also Colonia Clara, in a manner prescribed by his Longonian tutor, magister Mansur. It is said that he was also interested in imposing a network of *loquatores* to regulate different temples and monasteries of Sol cult. His ideas went completely contrary against the more personal focus of the Way-of-Sol in Misuia.

The other parts of Kyo is more unremarkable compared to our Barcinona, but the country of Misuia do have a series of naval ports. These ports and towns do not have a city council nor different guilds, but were demarcated by different political powers such as the *Ordo Magistri* and the temples. One of the sects of the Way-of-Sol, which is called Salvationism, which falsely suggests that salvation is pre-obtained by a vow of the Three and that any attempts of self-refinement and reformation are selfish. This lazy approach to the matter of Second Dawn however attracted powerful following among the Misuians, and that the Salvationist monasteries often set up urban districts with immunities and attracted large groups of rustic folks to follow them. These monasteries acted more of palatinates and often feud with neighbouring castellans or *shogones.*

There are five provinces in the kingdom. One of them, called Kinkia, is ruled by the king himself. Two of them are each governed by a *Shugo*, or *Archicustos.* Two of them are each governed by a *Tandius*, or we might call *Archijusticiarius.* These are, however, only titles for those who act as viceroys in these vast regions. These provinces are further divided into various diocese, each with its own *custos*. However, these offices were often dominated by families of the civilian ranks with a long history, and just like a Lumierian can be a duke of many duchies, so can a powerful *custos* rule various dioceses. There is also a principality, but it is not located on the island of Misuia itself but north-west of it on the continent. The ruler of this principality is called a *Togo*,[^2] which coincidentally means the same as *heritogo* in vernacular Giselian. The *Togo* rules a patchwork of colonial cities and their *contado* with a strong central force and a fleet, but he too often comes from these old families as well.

There are fourty-six dioceses within the kingdom of Misuia. The division of them are quite random, and some of these divisions does not make complete sense administratively. Some dioceses are fertile and rich with vast rice paddies, trading emporia and urban complexes. Some dioceses are extremely poor and mostly consist of mountain ranges and small parcels of land in small valleys. Some of these lands, despite flat, are full of uninhabited marshes and woodlands, yet being plagued by the feuds between small castellans and lordships, no programs of colonisation could be employed by the *custos.* Some of these dioceses are well-surveyed and tightly controlled. Financially, the officials of the kingdom often employ *modius* to imply the productivity of a said region's agrarian wealth. Yet this unit does not fully describe the wealth created by trade and handicraft.

The full name of Misuia might be rendered as *Terra felicis spicae frumenti campi munifici arundines,*[^1] in which the original meaning of Misuia is land of the lucky ears of grain.  The name comes from one of the oldest books of history in Misuia, already translated by the late magister Jaume de Girona into Chancery Luqianian with the name of *Liber Misuiae*. It is said that the legendary king Shoutoku, who is said to have a mind so sharp that he can listen to eight people at the same time, created this name and promulgated this with his articles of constitution, saying that according to the will of Sol, one should cherish harmony and follow the principle of not creating discordance.

As I have learned from magister Fucius from Cienia, Cienco is divided into many nations, but only two kingdoms exist, which are Cienia and Shunia. Cienia and Shunia are both regions of Cienco, but it is common for kings or emperors to name their dynasty with a specific region, or a name used by historical feudatories. Originally, the Antiocarate of Cienco is ruled by the house of *Sima*, or *marescalcus*. It is said that they killed the original ruler and established Chuvia. However, the Chuvian antiocar ruled indulgently and a general he trusted, who was a Baruqanian called Ishqandar, rebelled and took the capital city Changjing. The antiocar was strangled by his pursuers, but the seat of the emperor was preserved by his son, who escaped to the southern metropolis of Yingtian. Fuzianus was then proclaimed the antiocar of Cienia.

In the north, the rule of Ishqandar didn't last long, as his general Fuzianus and Tencensius rebelled against his tyranny. Fuzianus was not a Baruqanian but a Di'ite, while Tencensius was a Ciencese. Therefore, when Fuzianus defeated Tencensius and was proclaimed antiocar in Changjing, Tencensius escaped south to the court of Yingtian. But the rule of the *Sima* dynasty in Yingtian did not last long, as a powerful minister of them, Uanwenus, became the actual ruler of this country. Uanwenus is said to hold many tallies and the yellow *fascis* and became the *dux* over the military affairs of various states and "in the court, to the provinces", being allowed to carry a sword onto the palace, his residence uses the same etiquette of the three most powerful ministers, and he obtained the nine honorary bestowments.

However, when Uanwenus tried to usurp the country, just like the Carlenses of Parthenope usurping the Antiochenes, a fellow magnate and archchancellor called Iuliangcus defeated and executed him. This is merely a change of the pretender, as eventually Iuliangcus became another Uanwenus proclaimed himself as the antiocar of Shunia and forced the current antiocar to abdicate. But neither Shunia nor Cienia are legitimate enough to rule their realm in a stable manner. On the other hand, the great rivers and mountains in central Cienco hampered their attempts to conquer one another, and therefore Cienco is divided into the two rival kingdoms we know today. It is said that Fuzianus, advised by the famous *cancellarius* Wanmenus, appeared more Cienese instead of Di'ite.

Originally, there are nine regions in Cienco, but after the division, each of the polities claimed to have nine regions and retained the titles about the regions they have lost, setting up the southern substitutes of these names. This practice merely created more positions, eagerly awaiting imperial payments while disturbing the arrangement of administration.

A long long time before the intercalation, perhaps the same time of apostle Phaeton, it is said that a certain man, whose name was lost nowadays and is only called as Fucius, spend half of his life in a massive *peregrinatio*, spreading the Way-of-Sol, talking about clemency and civilisation. This Fucius was tall, handsome and he claimed that the way of the *Shi*, or reddars and officials, are one that not only pertains to ritual, poetry but also archery and swordsmanship. Fucius also claims that education applies not according to social order, but should be conducted according to each disciple's own character and manner. It is said that Fucius himself, when he reached 50 and knew the mandate of Sol, took up an iron stick and stormed the whole Cienco as an invincible conqueror, because he lived in a time of decaying rituals and musics, and he said that many barbarians who does not follow the manner and ritual of Sol, but after that he self-exiled to the southern mountains, seeing the corruption already growing in the elected king of Cienco. Therefore, in all continents of the known world, we have illuminated figures who spread the words of Sol.
