# **A Catechism of the Unyielding Faith**

(For the Instruction of the Faithful, according to the teachings of Ferrandus Chorloquator Chamauuiensis)

**Preceptor:** Let us begin. To know the Sun is to know our purpose. Recite the foundations of our faith.

#### **I. On the Nature of the Sun-in-Splendour**

**Q:** Who is the Sun-in-Splendour?  
**A:** It is the eternal Creator, ruler of all, and master of the heavens. It is the source from which all things come and the destination to which all souls must return.

**Q:** Is It a god of good?  
**A:** Such terms are for mortals. The Sun-in-Splendour is not a god of good, but a god of purpose. It illuminates the path forward for both the believer and the unbeliever, so that all may journey through this life toward their final union with It.

**Q:** If It guides us, does It decide our fate?  
**A:** No. It gifts us with the Light of reason, perception, and inspiration. This gift is our free will. To guide is not to decide. The Sun illuminates the paths of possibility, but we must choose which one to walk.

**Q:** Does It show mercy for our past failings?  
**A:** No. Time moves only forward. The Sun guides the path ahead and is not merciful to those who look back with regret.

**Q:** Is It still eternal, now that It is sundered?  
**A:** Yes. Its division into Plural Selves proves Its all-encompassing eternity. Though its form has changed, its essential nature remains, proving It is both consistent and everlasting.

**Q:** How then must we depict the Sun-in-Splendour?
**A:** It must never be depicted in human form. To give It the shape of a mortal is the fatal heresy of Man-as-Lord, the very error that brought about the Intercalation.

#### **II. On the Nature of the Light (Phos)**

**Q:** What is the Light?  
**A:** The Light, or Phos, is the carrier of the Sun's will. It is the overflowing of Its divinity in our world. To accept the Light is to accept a great and profound grace.

**Q:** What are the three qualities of the Light?  
**A:** The Light is Infinite, for it is everywhere. It is Unquestionable, for it cannot be refused. It is Unmerciful, for it exposes all things.

**Q:** Why do we say the Light is unmerciful?  
**A:** Because it strips away all shadows, falsehoods, and comforting illusions. It reveals the world and our souls as they truly are, without pity or prejudice. This purity is a gift, not a comfort.

**Q**: Who receives the Light?
**A**: The light is given on the basis of human birth but only manifests according to one's merit. Therefore, the Light manifests differently as one will or will not receive the grace of Sun-in-Splendour.

#### **III. On Time and the Intercalation**

**Q:** What was the Intercalation?  
**A:** It was a necessary rupture. Seeing the corruption of the old Church, the Sun-in-Splendour unleashed Its most brilliant fire to purge the world of heresy. This act of righteous war was the Heliomachy, which sundered Its form but cleansed existence.

**Q:** Was the sundering of the Sun a tragedy?  
**A:** It was the price of victory. Our world is now imperfect, living in a Twilight Age. Yet, this trial is also a blessing, for it has purified the world and given us our sacred purpose.

**Q:** What is our sacred purpose in this Twilight Age?  
**A:** It is our solemn duty to work towards the Second Dawn. We must strive to restore the Sun to Its unbroken wholeness, for the complete and unmerciful Light is the purest form of grace.

#### **IV. On the Soul (Phosus)**

**Q:** What is the soul?  
**A:** The soul, or Phosus, is our capacity to receive the Light. It is a property borrowed from the Sun, to be returned upon our passing.

**Q:** Are all souls equal in this life?  
**A:** No. While every soul's potential to receive the Light is infinite, our mortal capacity to contain and use it differs. This is the source of the natural order and the hierarchy among mortals, a reflection of our varying closeness to the Sun's grace.

#### **V. On the Plural Selves and the Sacred Trinity**

**Q:** Who are the Plural Selves?  
**A:** They are the limited aspects of the sundered Sun, through which we may understand Its works in our imperfect age.

**Q:** Who are the members of the Sacred Trinity?  
**A:** They are the Lamp-Lighter, who guides; the Dawn-Bringer, who arrives; and the Sun-Setter, who passes. They embody the principles of the Sun's journey as we can perceive it.

**Q:** May we depict the Trinity?  
**A:** Yes. Unlike the Sun-in-Splendour, the Trinity and other Plural Selves may be shown in forms we can understand, for they are Its aspects, Its divine vessels, not Its totality, and It always accommodates our weaknesses of not able to comprehend Its totality.

#### **VI. On the Second Dawn**

**Q:** What is the Second Dawn?  
**A:** It is the prophesied restoration. It is the culmination of our duty, when the sundered pieces of the Sun are made whole once more.

**Q:** How will it come to pass?  
**A:** The Lamp-Lighter and Its seven companions will ascend beyond the House of the Sun and reignite the heavens. The barriers between our world and the divine will shatter, and the true, undivided, and unmerciful Light will return.

#### **VII. On the Moon**

**Q**: What is the Moon?
**A**: The Moon is a holy organ, an instrument embedded with a fraction of Sol's essence for the sake of being close to Terra in the Intercalation. The scars on Moon attests its hard labour defending the World-of-the-days and reflecting, regulating and reposing Phos to us.

**Q**: Is Moon to be venerated?
**A**: Moon is to be venerated as a container of Sol's divine essence, not as an entity.
