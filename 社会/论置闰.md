**By Gaudschalk of Orbein, in the Thirteenth Year of the Intercalation.**

In the name of the Sun-in-Splendour, the Magnificent, the Unyielding, and in the name of the Phos which now burns brighter than ever in the hearts of the faithful.

Let it be known to all who read these words in the ages to come, if any age is to follow this one, that we live in a time of divine judgment and terrible glory. Thirteen years have passed since the heavens first tore open and the Sol Itself, in Its righteous fury, declared a holy war upon the beings of heaven. For years beyond counting, we had witnessed the decay. We saw the Church of the Invincible Sun, once the bastion of faith, grow fat with vanity and slow with corruption. We saw its loquators dally and its legates prevaricate while the true faith withered and the flock cried out for a true shepherd. And we saw the resurgence of that most ancient and wicked of evils, the apostasy of the Ellthonians, who in their blasphemy dare to give the divine a human face and set Man as Lord over all.

Seeing this, the Sun-in-Splendour, in Its infinite purpose and with a resolve utterly devoid of mortal mercy, did rise from Its throne. It unleashed Its own being against the false gods of the Ellthonians and all who would elevate Man to the station of God. A war began, not upon the waking earth, but in the firmament itself—a true **Heliomachy**, a war of heaven. This is no clash of iron or steel, but a war of principles, a conflict of cosmic laws waged with the very essence of creation.

Day by day, tidings reach us, not by courier but through tremors in our very souls, of the victories in the sky. We learn that Ellthon and his profane son, Dolzzany, are being unmade, their myriad forms and deceitful names scattered to the void, no matter how their followers on earth attempt to embellish their wicked relations. But their form persists and will persist till the end of Heliomachy. Yet, this celestial battle has inflicted grievous wounds upon the very being of our Sol. Its form, as we once knew It, is sundered.

And as heaven bleeds, so does the earth. Here below, under the leadership of the Ecumenical Pontiff in the holy city of Colonia Clara, the greatest of all sacred wars has been called. The armies of the faithful, the **Phosisgnati**—the Phos-Marked—have gathered under one banner. From the Himarians, those ancient and sacred defenders of the faith who have aided so many holy wars; to the bellicose Portavians, their hearts now aflame with true purpose; to the Thalassarans of the Sun's eldest daughter-church, their fleets turning from trade to war; to the sea-faring Yalmarians; and to us, the Giseli, our swords pledged to this final, ultimate cause. Call it the Flame-Bearing Expedition (Expeditio Flammafera), the Burning Crusade (Expeditio Incenda), or the Struggle (Jihad)—it is all one and the same: **an unprecedented war against the Ellthonian heresy across all lands.**

### **On the Nature of This War and the Failure of Prophecy**

Herein lies a truth that chills me to the marrow, a thought so dreadful I hesitate to commit it to parchment. **This war, this final conflict, was unforeseen.** Look to the holy books, to the Liber Lucis, to the prophecies of the seers of old. You will find portents of strife, of heresies rising and falling. But of this? Of a war so absolute that it rends the heavens and rewrites the laws of nature? Of a Heliomachy where the Sun Itself is both belligerent and battlefield? Of this, there is no mention.

The ancient prophecies spoke of trials, but they promised a foundation of certainty. They spoke of the Sol as a constant, an eternal observer and judge. They never foretold that the Judge Itself would step down from the bench and become a warrior, nor that the very ground of Being would quake and split beneath our feet. This is a war at the end of a path no map has ever charted. This is a storm beyond any horizon our prophets ever scanned. **It is as if the end of all things, an end that no scripture ever described, is upon us. A terrifying thought!** Yet it is no mere fancy. The evidence is all around us, in every stone and every soul.

### **On the Manifestations of Phos and the New Gifts**

The proof of this cosmic shift is not in scripture, but in our very flesh. **For since that first day, thirteen years ago, every one of us has felt the connection to the Sun strengthen, as if a veil has been torn away.** The Phos, once a gentle, mediated grace, now pours into the world like a torrent. And with it, new and terrible gifts have been bestowed upon the faithful.

I have seen with my own eyes a simple priest, in the heat of battle, call upon the Sun for a sign, and be answered not with a feeling of warmth, but with a comprehensible premonition, a clear vision of the enemy's next move. I have witnessed another, his hands outstretched not in prayer but in desperate command, call forth a beam of solid sunlight that pierced an Ellthonian siege engine as if it were paper. The Holy Guard, the *milites solis*, can now call upon a shimmering aura of light to shield their bodies from harm, or, with a cry to the Unmerciful Sun, strike with a Holy Smite that turns the profane to ash.

These are not the subtle miracles of the past age. This is raw, untamed power. It is the power of a universe at war. Every drop of blood we spill on the field seems to fuel the fires of heaven, and every victory we win below seems to echo a greater triumph above. We are no longer mere servants of the Sun; we have become Its very weapons. And though we are gaining ground in this mortal realm, driving the Ellthonians from njihov strongholds, we still cannot know the final outcome of the war in heaven. We do not know if, when the celestial dust settles, the world we once knew will exist at all.

### **On the Naming of This Age: The Intercalation**

Therefore, we stand at a precipice. The old age is dead, consumed in holy fire. The future, if there is to be one, is a terrifying blank. The very flow of time, the rhythm of a rising and setting Sun that has governed all life, has been fundamentally altered. The Sun's body is broken, Its unity sacrificed for the sake of victory. **Whatever form the Sun may take when this is over, the time of our world has been irrevocably changed.**

It falls to us, the witnesses, to give this cataclysm its proper name. It is not merely a war, for wars are fought within time. This event stands outside of time as we knew it. It is an insertion, a violent and necessary correction to the calendar of existence. It is a period inserted to purge the errors of the past and reset the course of destiny.

For this reason, I believe we must call this great and terrible transformation the **Intercalation**. Let this name stand as a testament to the age when heaven and earth were at war, when the laws of nature were suspended, and when the Sun Itself was broken and remade, all for the sake of its final, unyielding triumph.
