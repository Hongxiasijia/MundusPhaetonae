## II. Topics in Mid-to-Late Post Intercalation Giselic Administrative History

actually colloquia is a formal law making body having the right to draft but no ultimate right to decide, which is an imperial prerogative; however, no ruler can afford not to make a formal law without calling a colloquia (or Rat?); witnessing (recognovi) is done by the cabinet, shown as important officials.

- the institutional designs is in both ways: the parliament can draft a law but the ruler can also decree something, but he/she must first allow the parliament to discuss the decree's drafted contents. In practice the parliament (colloquia) is not very often called in periods without much need of extra parliamentary taxation (the state already has a per capita tax + some tollage + state property revenues + charter tax from autonomous urban/ecclesiastical bodies (as "Imperial" entities); - but there are always instances demanding more contributions) or legal reforms.
    
- Kammergericht runs independently but the appointment of judges is a mix of royal and cabinet appointees; these judges however can be impeached due to reasons like failing to achieve justice or siphoning judicial incomes
    
- some positions in the cabinet is reserved for suggested personnel from the parliament while others are to be named personally by the monarch
    
- the Imperial Herischild is no more than a series of honorific titles that degrade one rank per generation; it does however offer some kind of local connections based on tradition and its name. For Instance, the Grafio of Suderborg is **expected** to be from the certain region of Suderrichi; the imperial nobility is only codified by the code and uncodfied personnel does not enjoy any kind of privilege whatsoever, this prompts local aristocrats to at least look towards the centre for some times in their life.
    
- localism also applies in provincial leadership, which despite not codified, but cross regional naming seldom happened. The reserve of potential officials are centrally trained at court or institutions, but as soon as education is finished, these people are expected to obtain an office at least close to their locality; functionaries are usually locally appointed and out to be supported by a centrally given annual budget.
    
- representation is appointed on quota from each imperial circle (or province anyway); each goer elects its own representatives, which usually depends on the nature of the region - can be influential locals/freemen, merchant, clerics, or else. The Kolloquien is NOT demarcated into estates due to the fact of mixed representation ( at some period they are, but having a seat is all the same for different estates and their are no differences in voting power; special bodies like royal communes and royal eigenkirche have a limited number of seats (somewhat a lobbying power in favour of the monarchy if loyalty is nutured...)
    
- Provisional name: I can just use a neologism and call it Rîcheskolloquien.

## IV. Some thoughts on Feunicism

Feunicism (Giselian: Feheswesen) is a historical concept popular particularly in early cast steel era Phaëtona. The term originates from *fehu*, which means movable property or cattle in *Urlagland* (warring-states) Gisely. Late post-intercalary legal treatises in Gisely and Heldeland often associate landed tenancy with this term, especially between the ruler or the state and the tenant. The act of granting such land leases was called feuning. Therefore, earliest conceptualisations of feunicism were often based on tenurial structures. In early cast steel age, republican revolutionaries called to abolish monarchy and "feunicist" privileges, essentially connecting this term with the monarchy. Feunicism was therefore increasingly viewed as an overarching social institution encompassing post-intercalary Phaëtona. Its proponents, especially that of the constitutional history, also further links the term with the tradition of *Allgemeingesetze* and the liberties of the *Rîcheskolloquien*. Scholars from Syonese Republic and Lecipia, such as François Trossard and Augustino Tierro, on the contrary, often deem feunicism as a combination of various Giselic liberties and Thalassaran legalism. 

The most all-encompassing early work on feunicism which summarised these strands of thoughts was done by Heldish scholar Frank Johnhouse. Johnhouse, a leading historical theorist of the Rumburgh School, synthesised that feunicism is a social institution defined by the privatisation of public jurisdiction, power based on land and intense personal bonds as the primary type of vertical social connection. However, Johnhouse also admitted the difference between Giselian, Heldish and Lecipian feunicism, which is marked by their different historical trajectories, and also formed a comparative study with the Taifa period of Roqueel. On the contrary, Lecipian historian Marco Ambroggio of Risana proposed that feunicism was essentially a strict type of legal relationship between the lord and the reddars, which demands fealty based military service maintained by the land tenure of *fehu* or *beneficium*, later becoming a term defining monarch-nobility relationships. Both, however, agree that it was caused by a series of wars and rebellions in late pre-intercalary Phaëtona, but that 

A later Rumburgh school Thalassaran scholar, Georgios Kretanos, proposed to re-define feunic society not as a gradual development, but as the result of a series of tumultuous social changes. In his regional survey of Talbeland, Kretanos demonstrated the rise of castellans (*Burgoaldor*) who, through a process of *enchatellement*, successfully built a military power base to exert violent control on the peasantry and usurp the legal rights held by the count (*Grafio*). Disciples of Kretnos, such as Theodoros Gabalas and Henri Sternal, further summarised his points about how violence becomes a predominant way of expressing power relationship, and that the rise of redary (*Reddaritum*) marked the birth of a new, distinct class of nobility that is completely different from late Urlagland period *proceres*. This process involved strong social mobility, as attested by later nobility house chronicles, often describing the rise of an outsider or a humble person (*vir mediocris*) rising through service and bravery. Isabel Norris, a colleague of Kretanos, proposed that such change was based on a shift from economic to banal nature of the *Grundherrschaft*. Pia Kramer, working in the Suderrîch region, summarised these processes as *Zellularsierung*, that lordly jurisdictions around castles  formed cellular structures upon which later kingdom-wide governance was organised. This process involved a proprietisation of jurisdiction, upon which lordship was exercised at a spacial level instead of on ownership basis. This strand of thought was later termed as feunic revolution, or *Fehesrevolution*.

On the other hand, this term is also frequently cited in broader ancient history discussions. Yalmarian historiography contends the idea of bastard feunicism (*feonicismo bastardo*), proposing that historical regionalism and regional assemblies (*cortes*) originated from personal loyalties to territorialized local elites, where gentry (*hidalgos*) pledged allegiance to local magnates rather than central authority. Thalassaran historiography believes this concept is only relevant to social phenomena during the late Thalassaran Empire's civil war period, but overall, monarchical Thalassara after the Phobosian reforms maintained a more effective and centralized rule. The Maqchuqist academia of the United Contana has fiercely debated the applicability of "fief system" to Contana's ancient history. Ajayu Chiennco claims that the *Ayllu* system of ancient Contana's four-part polity embodied a state-led, feuny-based exploitation system, mainly manifesting as rent in kind and labor service. However, Nina Imasiri argues that ancient Contana's land ownership structure, dominated by the state ruling class, and its local-central relations did not embody a fragmentation and privatization of jurisdiction, and thus cannot be called a fief system. Whether in Contana's Ayacucho, or Qingzhou's Changjing and Sunpu, or Himaria's Tanweer, a series of debates arose concerning the validity of introducing the concept and its consistency with their own national historical development. However, terms like "feunic despotism" or "feunic ideology" still became slogans for social criticism.

However, when the *Fehesrevolution* thesis dominates the academia, it was never without its critics. The Himarian scholar Rashid Fikri published his seminal monograph, *Die Tyrannei einer Konstruktion: Fehen und Ministerales im frühen giselarissen Entiokerdum*, and concludes that while later legal concepts portray a monolithic “feunic” relationship, the contemporaries does not have a comprehensive, well-defined idea of feuny, benefice, vassalage or pledge. Fikri further claims that feunicism was essentially a cast-steel era invention and calls all academics to give up the conceptual baggage of feunicism altogether and stressed other types of vertical relationship between the community and the ruler. On the other hand, Dominik Berthold argues for a continuity of lordship structures from late Urlagland era to early post-intercalary *Entiokerdum*, and that a change was only shown during to the change of the nature of sources, which he calls *Wandlung den Quellen.* Berthold also contests that the revolutionary school fails to account for the social complexity already in place in the late Urlagland period, especially the persistence of a warrior ethos among the elites and the rigidity of social status already in place, against the idea of a suddenly rising *Reddaritum*. For instance, Berthold holds that mere phrasology of *quidam* or *Ingelramnus drudus* does not entail obscure standing, nor is the term *reddar* predominant during "its formative stage" before becoming a rank in the *Herishild*. Stefan Weiß and Frederick Conriat also rejected the existence of a sudden social transformation and are the proponents arguing for a more gradual, subtle process of historical change.

Although the criticisms of feunicism – be they of the concept *tout court* or of the models used to frame it – have often sought to renounce the term altogether, in practice they have led to renewed interest in the subject. Discussions were often framed through revisiting the sources. Some of these discussions do not necessarily associate with feunicism. Alessio Scalvini, for instance, stressed the applicability of a drastic transformation happened during the Intercalation due to the breakdown of traditional public structures, but he also stresses the presistence of some of these structures in early post-intercalary Lecipia. Karol Osten, researching late *Urlagland* period, observed that the difference in the nature of sources (be it normative or anecdotal) has led to vastly different interpretations on the transformation. Osten calls for a methodology incorporation sociological methods of networking and proposes that the process involved a formalisation of political rituals into more concrete, condensed forms. However, above all recent work underlines the flexibility and adaptability of feunicism – as Koenraad Patweert puts it, there was not so much one "feunicism" as many forms of feunicism in Phaetona in pre and post intercalary periods as well as in early cast-steel era. 

Finally, I wish to shortly discuss the gradual messing up of different semantic strands about feunicism. In mid-to-late Urlagland period Gisely, benefice (*Meda, beneficium*) and honour (*Ehren, honores*) often describes not a specific property, but an office often connected with a certain locality; ont he other hand, vassal (*Knîcht*, *vasuasor*) describes the status of a person of service to the king that is different (and likely lower) than *abba*, *rektor*, *herialdor*, *grafio*, etc. These different ministries (*ministeria*) was described as *militia*, therefore the word rendered a meaning of service. Later, *fehu* was used as a word describing tenurial land transactions distinct from *prekariat* granted by the monastery, which basically defines the frequency of reviewing ownership status differently. Late Urlagland period saw the development of legal professionals who, connecting *fehu* and *beneficium* in royal capitularies out of its original context, re-definde *fehu* as a type of personal relationship based on a pledge and land leases. However, this phenomenon of a pervasive word used to describe tenurial structure was later misused by historians to describe an overarching social institution, in which peasants, townsmen and reddars were all connected upward through "feunic relationships." On the other hand, *feha* was not used solely in military contexts as well, and as Berthold argued, there wasn't really a rise of a military class but rather a re-definition of some parts of the aristocracy. Therefore, employing feunicism, a term with such conceptual baggage, definitely demands caution and close reading of sources.

## V.  Waltheriesliott

与帖拉撒拉人的军事冲突是早期吉泽尔人文学和历史学记载的一个重要主题。其中最重要的作品自然是《瓦尔特里之歌》（Waltheriesliott）。这篇文本记载了苏德尔人的法官（Sculthezio）瓦尔特里、哈提人的参谋（Wiso）赫利曼和索尔德人的司马（Mariscalc）卢迪加尔率领一支联军征讨波尔塔维人的故事。在战争中，他们开始攻打波尔塔维亚人的白城久攻不下，随后遭遇了强大的阿戈帖亚英雄赫克托耳率领的援军。瓦尔特里因为个人的托大，将事务托付给了卢迪加尔。然而卢迪加尔先是不听劝告劫掠了波尔塔维人的太阳神庙，导致波尔塔维人的国王爱策尔的抵抗意志变得十分坚决，然后又因为自己的骄横而战败，然后又怯懦的逃回了自己的城市。故事的高潮部分是瓦尔特里率领士兵掩护撤退，却因为赫利曼战死而发怒，陷入了敌人的重重围攻。但是瓦尔特里的爱马却奇迹般地跳出重围，于是瓦尔特里策马狂奔，先后打败了急于追击，逐个前来的赫克托耳和爱策尔。故事的结尾是卢迪加尔在逃跑之后密谋率领索尔德人攻击苏德尔人的城市苏德尔堡，结果被瓦尔特里用一根标枪杀死。

毫无疑问，围绕着《瓦尔特里之歌》展开的各类讨论受篇幅所限，笔者在此不能赘述，只能提出几个有趣的点。首先是《瓦尔特里之歌》的文本传统。最早的一份现存的文本来自于《福希海姆抄本》（Kodekhs Forchhaimes），时间大概在置闰前350-300年之间。但是，这副抄本当中的词汇形式具有显著的不确定性，抄写者似乎时常在他生活的时代的语言常规（在Chlodomer of Mayen主持的通用古吉泽尔语翻译工程之后）和更古早的语言形式之间挣扎，并且出现了一些明显的从卢恩字母转写到莱齐皮亚字母的错误。而且这篇作品明显地缺乏在同时期常用的托尔纳语借词。一些例如头韵等方面的方式也暗示了更早的口头传统。然而可能更为实际的是一系列定位在置闰前1500-1000年的考古材料。瓦尔特里（ᚹᚨᛚᚦᛖᚱ）、苏德尔人瓦尔特里（ᛊᚢᛞᛖᚱᛁ ᚹᚨᛚᚦᛖᚱᛁ）、武士瓦尔特里（ᚹᚨᛚᚦᛖᚱᛁ ᛊᚲᚨᚱᚨ）这样的卢恩文字时常出现在与战士和跳跃的马一起出现的浮雕上面，其出土范围也十分广泛。这表明，瓦尔特里作为考古形象具有的影响力显然并不局限于我们现在定义的苏德里希地区，而是遍布整个古吉泽里希发达的核心地区，从最早发现类似装饰画的特鲁费尔到哈马维亚地区的奥库伊斯卡。这无疑体现了这个故事在各个地区之间得到了广泛的传播，也引发了有关故事真正起源的激烈讨论。一方面，以Thomas Kohle为代表的学派认为这体现了前置闰后期，苏德里希地区拥有的广泛文化影响力；在另一方面，Johannes Altendorfer则认为这首诗歌体现了一种形成中的共同文化遗产，但同时也体现了这一时期社会的多中心性质。但在另一方面，由于安提奥克斯·巴特拉科斯本人的活动时间确切无疑的在置闰前（1284-14 A.I.），而在这之前这首诗史诗的内容无疑并不存在，因此这也说明了一个史诗传统（武士瓦尔特里跃马跳出敌阵）逐渐扩散、变化、凝结成新的故事的过程。

这部史诗当中的族群划分明显更加具有内部视角，比《阿洛曼入侵记》更加细致。这篇文本对英雄主义以及领导责任的强调，无疑也为我们理解早期吉泽尔社会的价值观提供了宝贵的视角。瓦尔特里体现了一个勇猛、忠诚、负责任的军事领袖的形象，与卢迪加尔因骄横、怯懦和亵渎之举导致失败形成了鲜明的对比。同时，虽然作品并未过多强调太阳信仰的作用，但卢迪加尔遭受的报应一定程度上体现了圣所不可侵犯的社会观念。无论其历史基础如何，《瓦尔特里之歌》作为一部活生生的文化文本，其在吉泽里希社会长期流传并被反复解读、视觉化的现象本身，就证明了它在构建吉泽尔人集体记忆和身份认同方面不可或缺的重要地位。当然，《瓦尔特里之歌》并非唯一的早期吉泽尔文学。《希尔德布兰德的历险》《赫利曼的悲伤》和《苏德尔人的功绩》与它一起构成了一幅丰富、活跃的，由口头传说转向书面表达的早期文学图景。
